    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> monarch of ancient times mingled the 
			functions of priest and judge. It is therefore not altogether surprising 
			that even today a judicial system should be stamped with a certain 
			resemblance to an ecclesiastical hierarchy. If the Church of the Middle 
			Ages was &ldquo;an army encamped on the soil of Christendom, with its 
			outposts everywhere, subject to the most efficient discipline, animated 
			with a common purpose, every soldier panoplied with inviolability and 
			armed with the tremendous weapons which slew the soul,&rdquo; 
			the same words, slightly varied, may be applied to the Federal Judiciary 
			created by the American Constitution. The Judiciary of the United States, 
			though numerically not 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
			a large body, reaches through its process every part of the nation; its 
			ascendancy is primarily a moral one; it is kept in conformity with final 
			authority by the machinery of appeal; it is &ldquo;animated with a 
			common purpose&rdquo;; its members are &ldquo;panoplied&rdquo; 
			with what is practically a life tenure of their posts; and it
      is &ldquo;armed with the tremendous weapons&rdquo; which slay 
			legislation. And if the voice of the Church was the voice of God, so the 
			voice of the Court is the voice of the American people as this is recorded 
			in the Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hildebrand of American constitutionalism is John Marshall. The contest
      carried on by the greatest of the Chief Justices for the principles today
      associated with his name is very like that waged by the greatest of the
      Popes for the supremacy of the Papacy. Both fought with intellectual
      weapons. Both addressed their appeal to the minds and hearts of men. Both
      died before the triumph of their respective causes and amid circumstances
      of great discouragement. Both worked through and for great institutions
      which preceded them and which have survived them. And, as the achievements
      of Hildebrand cannot be justly appreciated without some knowledge of the
      ecclesiastical system which he did so much to develop, neither can the
      career of John 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
			Marshall be understood without some knowledge of the
      organization of the tribunal through which he wrought and whose power he
      did so much to exalt. The first chapter in the history of John Marshall
      and his influence upon the laws of the land must therefore inevitably deal
      with the historical conditions underlying the judicial system of which it
      is the capstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vital defect of the system of government provided by the soon obsolete
      Articles of Confederation lay in the fact that it operated not upon the
      individual citizens of the United States but upon the States in their
      corporate capacities. As a consequence the prescribed duties of any law
      passed by Congress in pursuance of powers derived from the Articles of
      Confederation could not be enforced. Theoretically, perhaps, Congress had
      the right to coerce the States to perform their duties; at any rate, a
      Congressional Committee headed by Madison so decided at the very moment
      (1781) when the Articles were going into effect. But practically such a
      course of coercion, requiring in the end the exercise of military power,
      was out of the question. Whence were to come the forces for military
      operations against recalcitrant States? From sister States which had
      themselves neglected their 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
			constitutional duties on various occasions? The
      history of the German Empire has demonstrated that the principle of state
      coercion is entirely feasible when a single powerful State dominates the
      rest of the confederation. But the Confederation of 1781 possessed no such
      giant member; it approximated a union of equals, and in theory it was
      entirely such. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_4-1" name="footer_4-1"></a>
	       &sup1; By the Articles of Confederation Congress itself was made
     &ldquo;the last resort of all disputes and differences &hellip; between
     two or more States concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any
     other cause whatever.&rdquo; It was also authorized to appoint
     &ldquo;courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on
     the high seas&rdquo; and &ldquo;for receiving and determining finally
     appeals in all cases of capture.&rdquo; But even before the
     Articles had gone into operation, Congress had, as early as
     1779, established a tribunal for such appeals, the old Court
     of Appeals in Cases of Capture. Thus at the very outset, and
     at a time when the doctrine of state sovereignty was
     dominant, the practice of appeals from state courts to a
     supreme national tribunal was employed, albeit within a
     restricted sphere. Yet it is less easy to admit that the
     Court of Appeals was, as has been contended by one
     distinguished authority, &ldquo;not simply the predecessor but one
     of the origins of the Supreme Court of the United States.&rdquo;
     The Supreme Court is the creation of the Constitution
     itself; it is the final interpreter of the law in every
     field of national power; and its decrees are carried into
     effect by the force and authority of the Government of which
     it is one of the three co&ouml;rdinate branches. That earlier
     tribunal, the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture, was, on
     the other hand, a purely legislative creation; its
     jurisdiction was confined to a single field, and that of
     importance only in time of war; and the enforcement of its
     decisions rested with the state governments.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      In the Federal Convention of 1787 the idea of state coercion required
      little discussion; for the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
			members were soon convinced that it involved an impracticable, illogical, 
			and unjust principle. The prevailing view was voiced by Oliver Ellsworth 
			before the Connecticut ratifying convention: &ldquo;We see how necessary 
			for Union is a coercive principle. No man pretends to the 
			contrary.&hellip; The only question is, shall it be a coercion of law or
      a coercion of arms? There is no other possible alternative. Where will
      those who oppose a coercion of law come out? &hellip; A necessary 
			consequence of their principles is a war of the States one against the 
			other. I am for coercion by law, that coercion which acts only upon 
			delinquent individuals.&rdquo; If anything, these words somewhat 
			exaggerate the immunity of the States from direct control by the National 
			Government, for, as James Madison pointed out in the 
			<i>Federalist,</i> &ldquo;in several cases &hellip; they [the
      States] must be viewed and proceeded against in their collective
      capacities.&rdquo; Yet Ellsworth stated correctly the controlling 
			principle of the new government: it was to operate upon individuals 
			through laws interpreted and enforced by its own courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Federal Judiciary was provided for in every plan offered on the floor of
      the Federal Convention. There was also a fairly general agreement among
      the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
			members on the question of &ldquo;judicial independence.&rdquo; Indeed, 
			most of the state constitutions already made the tenure of the principal 
			judges dependent upon their good behavior, though in some cases judges 
			were removable, as in England, upon the joint address of the two Houses of 
			the Legislature. That the Federal judges should be similarly removable by 
			the President upon the application of the Senate and House of 
			Representatives was proposed late in the Convention by Dickinson of 
			Delaware, but the suggestion received the vote of only one State. In the 
			end it was all but unanimously agreed that the Federal judges should be 
			removable only upon conviction following impeachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, while the Convention was in accord on this matter, another question,
      that of the organization of the new judiciary, evoked the sharpest
      disagreement among its members. All believed that there must be a national
      Supreme Court to impress upon the national statutes a construction that
      should be uniformly binding throughout the country; but they disagreed
      upon the question whether there should be inferior national courts.
      Rutledge of South Carolina wanted the state courts to be used as national
      courts of the first instance 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
			and argued that a right of appeal to the supreme national tribunal would 
			be quite sufficient &ldquo;to secure the national rights and uniformity 
			of judgment.&rdquo; But Madison pointed out that such an arrangement would 
			cause appeals to be multiplied most oppressively and that, furthermore, 
			it would provide no remedy for improper verdicts resulting from local 
			prejudices. A compromise was reached by leaving the question to the 
			discretion of Congress. The champions of local liberties, however, both 
			at Philadelphia and in the state conventions continued to the end to urge 
			that Congress should utilize the state courts as national tribunals of the 
			first instance. The significance of this plea should be emphasized because 
			the time was to come when the same interest would argue that for the 
			Supreme Court to take appeals from the state courts on any account was a 
			humiliation to the latter and an utter disparagement of
      State Rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more important than the relation of the Supreme Court to the judicial
      systems of the States was the question of its relation to the Constitution
      as a governing instrument. Though the idea that courts were entitled to
      pronounce on the constitutionality of legislative acts had received
      countenance in a few dicta in some of the States and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
			perhaps in one or two decisions, this idea was still at best in 1787 but 
			the germ of a possible institution. It is not surprising, therefore, that 
			no such doctrine found place in the resolutions of the Virginia plan which 
			came before the Convention. By the sixth resolution of this plan the 
			national legislature was to have the power of negativing all state laws 
			which, in its opinion, contravened &ldquo;the Articles of Union, or any 
			treaty subsisting under the authority of the Union,&rdquo; and by the 
			eighth resolution &ldquo;a convenient number of the national 
			judiciary&rdquo; were to be associated with the Executive, 
			&ldquo;with authority to examine every act of the national legislature 
			before it shall operate, and every act of a particular legislature 
			before a negative thereon shall be final&rdquo; and to impose a 
			qualified veto in either case.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as discussion in the Convention proceeded, three principles obtained
      clearer and clearer recognition, if not from all its members, certainly
      from the great majority of them: first, that the Constitution is law, in
      the sense of being enforcible by courts; secondly, that it is supreme law,
      with which ordinary legislation must be in harmony to be valid; and
      thirdly&mdash;a principle deducible from the doctrine of the separation of
      powers&mdash;that, while the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
			function of making new law belongs to the
      legislative branch of the Government, that of expounding the standing law,
      of which the Constitution would be part and parcel, belongs to the
      Judiciary. The final disposition of the question of insuring the
      conformity of ordinary legislation to the Constitution turned to no small
      extent on the recognition of these three great principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposal to endow Congress with the power to negative state
      legislation having been rejected by the Convention, Luther Martin of
      Maryland moved that &ldquo;the legislative acts of the United States made 
			in virtue and in pursuance of the Articles of Union, and all treaties made 
			or ratified under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
      law of the respective States, and the judiciaries of the several States
      shall be bound thereby in their decisions, anything in the respective laws
      of the individual States to the contrary notwithstanding.&rdquo; The 
			motion was agreed to without a dissenting voice and, with some slight 
			changes, became Article VIII of the report of the Committee of Detail of 
			the 7th of August, which in turn became &ldquo;the linch-pin of the 
			Constitution.&rdquo; &sup1; Then, on the 27th of August, it was 
			agreed that 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
			&ldquo;the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court&rdquo; should &ldquo;extend 
			to all cases arising under the laws passed by the Legislature of the 
			United States,&rdquo; whether, that is, such laws should be in pursuance 
			of the Constitution or not. The foundation was thus laid for the Supreme 
			Court to claim the right to review any state decision challenging on 
			constitutional grounds the validity of any act of Congress. Presently this 
			foundation was broadened by the substitution of the phrase &ldquo;judicial 
			power of the United States&rdquo; for the phrase &ldquo;jurisdiction of 
			the Supreme Court,&rdquo; and also by the insertion of the words 
			&ldquo;this Constitution&rdquo; and &ldquo;the&rdquo; before the word 
			&ldquo;laws&rdquo; in what ultimately became Article III of the 
			Constitution. The implications of the phraseology of this part of the
      Constitution are therefore significant:

		<blockquote>
    <p>
      Section I. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one

      Such, then, is the verbal basis of the power of the courts, and
      particularly of the Supreme Court, to review the legislation of any State,
      with reference to the Constitution, to acts of Congress, or to treaties of
      the United States. Nor can there be much doubt that the members of the
      Convention were also substantially agreed that the Supreme Court was
      endowed with the further right to pass upon the constitutionality of acts
      of Congress. The available evidence strictly contemporaneous with the
      framing and ratification of the Constitution shows us seventeen of the
      fifty-five members of the Convention asserting the existence of this
      prerogative in unmistakable terms and only three using language that can
      be construed to the contrary. More striking than that, however, is the
      fact that 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
			these seventeen names include fully three-fourths of the leaders
      of the Convention, four of the five members of the Committee of Detail
      which drafted the Constitution, and four of the five members of the
      Committee of Style which gave the Constitution its final form. And these
      were precisely the members who expressed themselves on all the interesting
      and vital subjects before the Convention, because they were its statesmen
      and articulate members. &sup1;

				&sup1; The entries under the names of these members in the Index
     to Max Farrand&rsquo;s <i>Records of the Federal Convention</i> occupy
     fully thirty columns, as compared with fewer than half as
     many columns under the names of all remaining members.

      No part of the Constitution has realized the hopes of its framers more
      brilliantly than has Article III, where the judicial power of the United
      States is defined and organized, and no part has shown itself to be more
      adaptable to the developing needs of a growing nation. Nor is the reason
      obscure: no part came from the hands of the framers in more fragmentary
      shape or left more to the discretion of Congress and the Court.

    <p>
      Congress is thus placed under constitutional obligation to establish one
      Supreme Court, but the size of that Court is for Congress itself to
      determine, as well as whether there shall be any inferior Federal 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
			Courts at all. What, it may be asked, is the significance of the word 
			&ldquo;shall&rdquo; in Section II? Is it merely permissive or is it 
			mandatory? And, in either event, when does a case arise under the 
			Constitution or the laws of the United States? Here, too, are questions 
			which are left for Congress in the first instance and for the Supreme 
			Court in the last. Further, the Supreme Court is given 
			&ldquo;original jurisdiction&rdquo; in certain specified cases and
      &ldquo;appellate jurisdiction&rdquo; in all others&mdash;subject, 
			however, to &ldquo;such exceptions and under such regulations as the 
			Congress shall make.&rdquo; Finally, the whole question of the relation of 
			the national courts to the state judiciaries, though it is elaborately 
			discussed by Alexander Hamilton in the <i>Federalist,</i> 
			is left by the Constitution itself to the practically undirected wisdom 
			of Congress, in the exercise of its power to pass &ldquo;all laws 
			which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
      execution&rdquo; &sup1; its own powers and those of the other 
			departments of the Government.

    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      Almost the first official act of the Senate of the United States, after it
      had perfected its own organization, was the appointment of a committee 
			&ldquo;to bring in a bill for organizing the judiciary of the United 
			States.&rdquo; This committee consisted of eight 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
			members, five of whom, including Oliver Ellsworth, its chairman, had been 
			members of the Federal Convention. To Ellsworth is to be credited largely 
			the authorship of the great Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, the 
			essential features of which still remain after 130 years in full force 
			and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This famous measure created a chief justiceship and five associate
      justiceships for the Supreme Court; fifteen District Courts, one for each
      State of the Union and for each of the two Territories, Kentucky and Ohio;
      and, to stand between these, three Circuit Courts consisting of two
      Supreme Court justices and the local district judge. The 
			&ldquo;cases&rdquo; and &ldquo;controversies&rdquo; comprehended by the 
			Act fall into three groups: first, those brought to enforce the national 
			laws and treaties, original jurisdiction of which was assigned to the 
			District Courts; secondly, controversies between citizens of different 
			States &sup1;; lastly, cases brought originally under a state law and in 
			a State Court but finally coming to involve some claim of right based on 
			the National Constitution, laws, or treaties. For these the twenty-fifth 
			section of the Act provided that, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
			where the decision of the highest State Court competent under the
      state law to pass upon the case was adverse to the claim thus set up, an
      appeal on the issue should lie to the Supreme Court. This twenty-fifth
      section received the hearty approval of the champions of State Rights,
      though later on it came to be to them an object of fiercest resentment. In
      the Senate, as in the Convention, the artillery of these gentlemen was
      trained upon the proposed inferior Federal Judiciary, which they pictured
      as a sort of Gargantua ready at any moment &ldquo;to swallow up the state
      courts.&rdquo;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_15-1" name="footer_15-1"></a>
				&sup1;  Where the national jurisdiction was extended to these in
     the interest of providing an impartial tribunal, it was
     given to the Circuit Courts.

      The first nominations for the Supreme Court were sent in by Washington two
      days after he had signed the Judiciary Act. As finally constituted, the
      original bench consisted of John Jay of New York as Chief Justice, and of
      John Rutledge of South Carolina, William Cushing of Massachusetts, John
      Blair of Virginia, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, and James Iredell of
      North Carolina as Associate Justices. All were known to be champions of
      the Constitution, three had been members of the Federal Convention, four
      had held high judicial offices in their home States, and all but Jay were
      on record as advocates of the principle of judicial review. Jay was one of
      the authors of the <i>Federalist</i>, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
			had achieved a great diplomatic reputation in the negotiations of 1782, 
			and possessed the political backing of the powerful Livingston family 
			of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judiciary Act provided for two terms of court annually, one commencing
      the first Monday of February, and the other on the first Monday of August.
      On February 2, 1790, the Court opened its doors for the first time in an
      upper room of the Exchange in New York City. Up to the February term of
      1793 it had heard but five cases, and until the accession of Marshall it
      had decided but fifty-five. The justices were largely occupied in what one
      of them described as their &ldquo;post-boy duties,&rdquo; that is, in 
			riding their circuits. At first the justices rode in pairs and were 
			assigned to particular circuits. As a result of this practice, the 
			Southern justices were forced each year to make two trips of nearly two 
			thousand miles each and, in order to hold court for two weeks, often 
			passed two months on the road. In 1792, however, Congress changed the law 
			to permit the different circuits to be taken in turn and by single 
			justices, and in the meantime the Court had, in 1791, followed the rest of 
			the Government to Philadelphia, a rather more central seat. Then, in 1802, 
			the abolition of the August term eased the burdens of the justices still 
			more. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
			But of course they still had to put up with bad roads, bad inns, and bad 
			judicial quarters or sometimes none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet that the life of a Supreme Court justice was not altogether one of
      discomfort is shown by the following alluring account of the travels of
      Justice Cushing on circuit: &ldquo;He traveled over the whole of the 
			Union, holding courts in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. His 
			traveling equipage was a four-wheeled phaeton, drawn by a pair of horses, 
			which he drove. It was remarkable for its many ingenious arrangements 
			(all of his contrivance) for carrying books, choice groceries, and other 
			comforts. Mrs. Cushing always accompanied him, and generally read aloud 
			while riding. His faithful servant Prince, a jet-black negro, whose 
			parents had been slaves in the family and who loved his master with 
			unbounded affection, followed.&rdquo; &sup1; Compared with that of a 
			modern judge always confronted with a docket of eight or nine hundred 
			cases in arrears, Justice Cushing&rsquo;s lot was perhaps not so 
			unenviable.

      The pioneer work of the Supreme Court in constitutional interpretation
      has, for all but special 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
			students, fallen into something like obscurity owing to the luster of 
			Marshall&rsquo;s achievements and to his habit of deciding cases without 
			much reference to precedent. But these early labors are by no means 
			insignificant, especially since they pointed the way to some of 
			Marshall&rsquo;s most striking decisions. In Chisholm <i>vs.</i> Georgia, 
			&sup1; which was decided in 1793, the Court ruled, in the face of an 
			assurance in the <i>Federalist</i> to the contrary, that an individual 
			might sue a State; and though this decision was speedily disallowed by 
			resentful debtor States by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, its 
			underlying premise that, &ldquo;as to the purposes of the Union, the 
			States are not sovereign&rdquo; remained untouched; and three years later 
			the Court affirmed the supremacy of national treaties over conflicting 
			state laws and so established a precedent which has never been disturbed. 
			&sup2; Meantime the Supreme Court was advancing, though with notable 
			caution, toward an assertion of the right to pass upon the 
			constitutionality of acts of Congress. Thus in 1792, Congress ordered the 
			judges while on circuit to pass upon pension claims, their determinations 
			to be reviewable by the Secretary of the Treasury. In protests which they 
			filed with the President, the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
			judges stated the dilemma which confronted them: either the new duty was 
			a judicial one or it was not; if the latter, they could not perform it, 
			at least not in their capacity as judges; if the former, then their 
			decisions were not properly reviewable by an executive officer. Washington 
			promptly sent the protests to Congress, whereupon some extremists raised 
			the cry of impeachment; but the majority hastened to amend the Act so as 
			to meet the views of the judges. &sup3; Four years later, in the Carriage 
			Tax case, <span class="superscript">4</span> the only question argued 
			before the Court was that of the validity of a congressional excise. Yet 
			as late as 1800 we find Justice Samuel Chase of Maryland, who had 
			succeeded Blair in 1795, expressing skepticism as to the right of the 
			Court to disallow acts of Congress on the ground of their
			unconstitutionality, though at the same time admitting that the prevailing
      opinion among bench and bar supported the claim.

      The great lack of the Federal Judiciary during these early years, and it
      eventually proved well-nigh fatal, was one of leadership. Jay was a
      satisfactory magistrate, but he was not a great force on the Supreme
      Bench, partly on account of his peculiarities of temperament and his
      ill
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
			health, and partly because, even before he resigned in 1795 to run for
      Governor in New York, his judicial career had been cut short by an
      important diplomatic assignment to England. His successor, Oliver
      Ellsworth, also suffered from ill health, and he too was finally
      sacrificed on the diplomatic altar by being sent to France in 1799. During
      the same interval there were also several resignations among the associate
      justices. So, what with its shifting personnel, the lack of business, and
      the brief semiannual terms, the Court secured only a feeble hold on the
      imagination of the country. It may be thought, no doubt, that judges
      anxious to steer clear of politics did not require leadership in the
      political sense. But the truth of the matter is that willy-nilly the
      Federal Judiciary at this period was bound to enter politics, and the only
      question was with what degree of tact and prudence this should be done. It
      was to be to the glory of Marshall that he recognized this fact perfectly
      and with mingled boldness and caution grasped the leadership which the
      circumstances demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation at the beginning was precarious enough. While the
      Constitution was yet far from having commended itself to the back country
      democracy, that is, to the bulk of the American 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
			people, the normal duties of the lower Federal Courts brought the judges 
			into daily contact with prevalent prejudices and misconceptions in their 
			most aggravated forms. Between 1790 and 1800 there were two serious 
			uprisings against the new Government: the Whisky Rebellion of 1794 and 
			Fries&rsquo;s Rebellion five years later. During the same period the 
			popular ferment caused by the French Revolution was at its height. 
			Entrusted with the execution of the laws, the young Judiciary 
			&ldquo;was necessarily thrust forward to bear the brunt in
      the first instance of all the opposition levied against the federal 
			head,&rdquo; its revenue measures, its commercial restrictions, 
			its efforts to enforce neutrality and to quell uprisings. In short, it 
			was the point of attrition between the new system and a suspicious, 
			excited populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to make bad matters worse, Congress in 1798 passed the Sedition Act.
      Had political discretion instead of party venom governed the judges, it is
      not unlikely that they would have seized the opportunity presented by this
      measure to declare it void and by doing so would have made good their
      censorship of acts of Congress with the approval of even the Jeffersonian
      opposition. Instead, they enforced the Sedition Act, often with gratuitous
      rigor, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
			while some of them even entertained prosecutions under a supposed
      Common Law of the United States. The immediate sequel to their action was
      the claim put forth in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions that the
      final authority in interpreting the National Constitution lay with the
      local legislatures. Before the principle of judicial review was supported
      by a single authoritative decision, it had thus become a partisan issue!

    <p>
      A few months later Jefferson was elected President, and the Federalists,
      seeing themselves about to lose control of the Executive and Congress,
      proceeded to take steps to convert the Judiciary into an avowedly partisan
      stronghold. By the Act of February 13, 1801, the number of associate
      justiceships was reduced to four, in the hope that the new Administration
      might in this way be excluded from the opportunity of making any
      appointments to the Supreme Bench, the number of district judgeships was
      enlarged by five, and six Circuit Courts were created which furnished
      places for sixteen more new judges. When John Adams, the retiring
      President, proceeded with the aid of the Federalist majority in the Senate
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
			and of his Secretary of State, John Marshall, to fill up the new posts
      with the so-called &ldquo;midnight judges,&rdquo; &sup1; the rage and 
			consternation of the Republican leaders broke all bounds. The Federal 
			Judiciary, declared John Randolph, had become &ldquo;an hospital of 
			decayed politicians.&rdquo; Others pictured the country as reduced, 
			under the weight of &ldquo;supernumerary judges&rdquo; and
      hosts of attendant lawyers, to the condition of Egypt under the Mamelukes.
      Jefferson&rsquo;s concern went deeper. &ldquo;They have retired into the 
			judiciary as a stronghold,&rdquo; he wrote Dickinson. &ldquo;There 
			the remains of Federalism are to be preserved and fed from the Treasury, 
			and from that battery all the works of Republicanism are to be beaten down 
			and destroyed.&rdquo; The Federal Judiciary, as a co&ouml;rdinate and 
			independent branch of the Government, was confronted with a fight for 
			life!

				The supposition, however, was without foundation.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, late in November, 1800, Ellsworth had resigned, and Adams had
      begun casting about for his successor. First he turned to Jay, who
      declined on the ground that the Court, &ldquo;under a system so 
			defective,&rdquo; would never &ldquo;obtain the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
			energy, weight, and dignity which were essential
      to its affording due support to the National Government, nor acquire the
      public confidence and respect which, as the last resort of the justice of
      the nation, it should possess.&rdquo; Adams now bethought himself of his
      Secretary of State and, without previously consulting him, on January 20,
      1801, sent his name to the Senate. A week later the Senate ratified the
      nomination, and on the 4th of February Marshall accepted the appointment.
      The task despaired of by Jay and abandoned by Ellsworth was at last in
      capable hands.

    <p class="chaptertitle">Marshall&rsquo;s Early Years</p>
		
		
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">John Marshall</span> was born on September 24, 1755, 
			in Fauquier County, Virginia. Though like Jefferson he was descended on 
			his mother&rsquo;s side from the Randolphs of Turkey Island, colonial 
			grandees who were also progenitors of John Randolph, Edmund Randolph, and 
			Robert E. Lee, his father, Thomas Marshall, was &ldquo;a planter of 
			narrow fortune&rdquo; and modest lineage and a pioneer. Fauquier was then 
			on the frontier, and a few years after John was born the family moved 
			still farther westward to a place called &ldquo;The Hollow,&rdquo; a 
			small depression on the eastern slope of the Blue
      Ridge. The external furnishings of the boy&rsquo;s life were extremely
      primitive, a fact which Marshall used later to recall by relating that his
      mother and sisters used thorns for buttons and that hot mush flavored with
      balm leaf was regarded as a very special dish. Neighbors of course, were
      few and far between, but society was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
			not lacking for all that. As the
      first of fifteen children, all of whom reached maturity, John found ample
      opportunity to cultivate that affectionate helpfulness and gayety of
      spirit which in after years even enemies accounted one of his most notable
      traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the various influences which, during the plastic years of boyhood
      and youth, went to shape the outlook of the future Chief Justice high rank
      must be accorded his pioneer life. It is not merely that the spirit of the
      frontier, with its independence of precedent and its audacity of
      initiative, breathes through his great constitutional decisions, but also
      that in being of the frontier Marshall escaped being something else. Had
      he been born in lowland Virginia, he would have imbibed the intense
      localism and individualism of the great plantation, and with his turn of
      mind might well have filled the r&ocirc;le of Calhoun instead of that very
      different r&ocirc;le he actually did fill. There was, indeed, one great 
			planter with whom young Marshall was thrown into occasional contact, and 
			that was his father&rsquo;s patron and patron saint, Washington. The 
			appeal made to the lad&rsquo;s imagination by the great Virginian was 
			deep and abiding. And it goes without saying that the horizons suggested 
			by the fame of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
			Fort Venango and Fort Duquesne were not those of seaboard Virginia but of
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many are the great men who have owed their debt to a mother&rsquo;s loving
      helpfulness and alert understanding. Marshall, on the other hand, was his
      father&rsquo;s child. &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he was wont to declare 
			in after years, &ldquo;was a far abler man than any of his sons. To him 
			I owe the solid foundations of all my success in life.&rdquo; What 
			were these solid foundations? One was a
      superb physical constitution; another was a taste for intellectual
      delights; and to the upbuilding of both these in his son, Thomas Marshall
      devoted himself with enthusiasm and masculine good sense, aided on the one
      hand by a very select library consisting of Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden,
      and Pope, and on the other by the ever fresh invitation of the
      mountainside to health-giving sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope was the lad&rsquo;s especial textbook, and we are told that he had
      transcribed the whole of the <i>Essay on Man</i> by the time he was twelve 
			and some of the <i>Moral Essays</i> as well, besides having 
			&ldquo;committed to memory many of the most interesting passages of that 
			distinguished poet.&rdquo; The result is to be partially discerned many 
			years later in certain tricks of Marshall&rsquo;s style; but indeed the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
			influence of the great moralist must have penetrated far deeper. The 
			<i>Essay on Man</i> filled, we may surmise, much the same place in the 
			education of the first generation of American judges that Herbert 
			Spencer&rsquo;s <i>Social Statics</i> filled in that of the judges of a
      later day. The <i>Essay on Man</i> pictures the universe as a species of
      constitutional monarchy governed &ldquo;not by partial but by general 
			laws&rdquo;; in &ldquo;man&rsquo;s imperial race&rdquo; this 
			beneficent sway expresses itself in two principles, &ldquo;self-love 
			to urge, and reason to restrain&rdquo;; instructed by reason, self-love 
			lies at the basis of all human institutions, the state, government, laws, 
			and has &ldquo;found the private in the public good&rdquo;; so, on
      the whole, justice is the inevitable law of life. &ldquo;Whatever is, 
			is right.&rdquo; It is interesting to suppose that while Marshall was 
			committing to memory the complacent lines of the <i>Essay on Man,</i> 
			his cousin Jefferson may have been deep in the <i>Essay on the Origin 
			of Inequality.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of fourteen Marshall was placed for a few months under the
      tuition of a clergyman named Campbell, who taught him the rudiments of
      Latin and introduced him to Livy, Cicero, and Horace. A little later the
      great debate over American rights burst forth and became with Marshall, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
			as
      with so many promising lads of the time, the decisive factor in
      determining his intellectual bent, and he now began reading Blackstone.
      The great British orators, however, whose eloquence had so much to do, for
      instance, with shaping Webster&rsquo;s genius, came too late to influence 
			him greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The part which the War of Independence had in shaping the ideas and the
      destiny of John Marshall was most important. As the news of Lexington and
      Bunker Hill passed the Potomac, he was among the first to spring to arms.
      His services at the siege of Norfolk, the battles of Brandywine,
      Germantown, and Monmouth, and his share in the rigors of Valley Forge and
      in the capture of Stony Point, made him an American before he had ever had
      time to become a Virginian. As he himself wrote long afterwards: &ldquo;I 
			had grown up at a time when the love of the Union and the resistance to 
			Great Britain were the inseparable inmates of the same bosom; &hellip; 
			when the maxim &lsquo;United we stand, divided we fall&rsquo; was the 
			maxim of every orthodox American. And I had imbibed these sentiments so 
			thoroughly that they constituted a part of my being. I carried them with 
			me into the army, where I found myself associated with brave men from 
			different States, who were risking life and everything valuable in a 
			common 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
			cause believed by
      all to be most precious, and where I was confirmed in the habit of
      considering America as my country and Congress as my government.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Love of country, however, was not the only quality which soldiering
      developed in Marshall. The cheerfulness and courage which illuminated his
      patriotism brought him popularity among men. Though but a lieutenant, he
      was presently made a deputy judge advocate. In this position he displayed
      notable talent in adjusting differences between officers and men and also
      became acquainted with Washington&rsquo;s brilliant young secretary, 
			Alexander Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      While still in active service in 1780, Marshall attended a course of law
      lectures given by George Wythe at William and Mary College. He owed this
      opportunity to Jefferson, who was then Governor of the State and who had
      obtained the abolition of the chair of divinity at the college and the
      introduction of a course in law and another in medicine. Whether the
      future Chief Justice was prepared to take full advantage of the
      opportunity thus offered is, however, a question. He had just fallen heels
      over head in love with Mary Ambler, whom three years later he married, and
      his notebook seems to show us that his thoughts 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
			were quite as much upon his sweetheart as upon the lecturer&rsquo;s 
			wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      None the less, as soon as the Courts of Virginia reopened, upon the
      capitulation of Cornwallis, Marshall hung out his shingle at Richmond and
      began the practice of his profession. The new capital was still hardly
      more than an outpost on the frontier, and conditions of living were rude
      in the extreme. &ldquo;The Capitol itself,&rdquo; we are told, 
			&ldquo;was an ugly structure&mdash;&lsquo;a mere wooden 
			barn&rsquo;&mdash;on an unlovely site at the foot of a hill. The
      private dwellings scattered about were poor, mean, little wooden 
			houses.&rdquo; &ldquo;Main Street was still unpaved, deep with 
			dust when dry and so muddy during a rainy season that wagons sank up to 
			the axles.&rdquo; It ended in gullies and swamps. Trade, which was still 
			in the hands of the British merchants, involved for the most part 
			transactions in skins, furs, ginseng, snakeroot, and &ldquo;dried 
			rattlesnakes&mdash;used to make a viper broth for consumptive 
			patients.&rdquo; &ldquo;There was but one church building and
      attendance was scanty and infrequent.&rdquo; Not so, however, of 
			Farmicola&rsquo;s tavern, whither card playing, drinking, and ribaldry 
			drew crowds, especially when the legislature was in session. &sup1;

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>		
      But there was one institution of which Richmond could boast, even in
      comparison with New York, Boston, or Philadelphia, and that was its Bar.
      Randolph, Wickham, Campbell, Call, Pendleton, Wythe&mdash;these are names
      whose fame still survives wherever the history of the American Bar is
      cherished; and it was with their living bearers that young Marshall now
      entered into competition. The result is somewhat astonishing at first
      consideration, for even by the standards of his own day, when digests,
      indices, and the other numerous aids which now ease the path of the young
      attorney were generally lacking, his preparation had been slight. Several
      circumstances, however, came to his rescue. So soon after the Revolution
      British precedents were naturally rather out of favor, while on the other
      hand many of the questions which found their way into the courts were
      those peculiar to a new country and so were without applicable precedents
      for their solution. What was chiefly demanded of an attorney in this
      situation was a capacity for attention, the ability to analyze an
      opponent&rsquo;s argument, and a discerning eye for fundamental issues.
      Competent observers soon made the discovery that young Marshall possessed
      all these faculties to a marked degree and, what was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>		
			just as important, his modesty made recognition by his elders easy and 
			gracious.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1782 until the adoption of the Constitution, Marshall was almost
      continuously a member of the Virginia Legislature. He thus became a
      witness of that course of policy which throughout this period daily
      rendered the state governments more and more &ldquo;the hope of their 
			enemies, the despair of their friends.&rdquo; The termination of 
			hostilities against England had relaxed the already feeble bonds 
			connecting the States. Congress had powers which were only recommendatory, 
			and its recommendations were ignored by the local legislatures. The army, 
			unpaid and frequently in actual distress, was so rapidly losing its morale 
			that it might easily become a prey to demagogues. The treaties of the new
      nation were flouted by every State in the Union. Tariff wars and
      conflicting land grants embittered the relations of sister States. The
      foreign trade of the country, it was asserted, &ldquo;was regulated, 
			taxed, monopolized, and crippled at the pleasure of the maritime powers of
      Europe.&rdquo; Burdened with debts which were the legacy of an era of
      speculation, a considerable part of the population, especially of the
      farmer class, was demanding measures of relief which threatened the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>		
      security of contracts. &ldquo;Laws suspending the collection of debts, 
			insolvent laws, instalment laws, tender laws, and other expedients of a 
			like nature, were familiarly adopted or openly and boldly 
			vindicated.&rdquo; &sup1;

				&sup1;  This review of conditions under the later Confederation is

				this point, on Marshall&rsquo;s <i>Life of Washington</i> and certain 
				letters of his to Story.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      From the outset Marshall ranged himself on the side of that party in the
      Virginia Legislature which, under the leadership of Madison, demanded with
      growing insistence a general and radical constitutional reform designed at
      once to strengthen the national power and to curtail state legislative
      power. His attitude was determined not only by his sympathy for the
      sufferings of his former comrades in arms and by his veneration for his
      father and for Washington, who were of the same party, but also by his
      military experience, which had rendered the pretensions of state
      sovereignty ridiculous in his eyes. Local discontent came to a head in the
      autumn of 1786 with the outbreak of Shays&rsquo;s Rebellion in western
      Massachusetts. Marshall, along with the great body of public men of the
      day, conceived for the movement the gravest alarm, and the more so since
      he considered it as the natural 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>		
			culmination of prevailing tendencies. In a letter to James Wilkinson 
			early in 1787, he wrote: &ldquo;These violent &hellip;
      dissensions in a State I had thought inferior in wisdom and virtue to no
      one in our Union, added to the strong tendency which the politics of many
      eminent characters among ourselves have to promote private and public
      dishonesty, cast a deep shade over that bright prospect which the
      Revolution in America and the establishment of our free governments had
      opened to the votaries of liberty throughout the globe. I fear, and there
      is no opinion more degrading to the dignity of man, that those have truth
      on their side who say that man is incapable of governing himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall accordingly championed the adoption of the Constitution of 1787
      quite as much because of its provisions for diminishing the legislative
      powers of the States in the interest of private rights as because of its
      provisions for augmenting the powers of the General Government. His
      attitude is revealed, for instance, in the opening words of his first
      speech on the floor of the Virginia Convention, to which he had been
      chosen a member from Richmond: &ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I conceive that the 
			object of the discussion now before us is whether democracy or despotism 
			be most eligible.&hellip; The 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>		
			supporters of the Constitution claim the title of being firm friends of 
			liberty and the rights of man.&hellip; We prefer this system because we 
			think it a well-regulated democracy.&hellip; What are the favorite maxims 
			of democracy? A strict observance of justice and public faith.&hellip;
      Would to Heaven that these principles had been observed under the present
      government. Had this been the case the friends of liberty would not be
      willing now to part with it.&rdquo; The point of view which Marshall here
      assumed was obviously the same as that from which Madison, Hamilton,
      Wilson, and others on the floor of the Federal Convention had freely
      predicted that republican liberty must disappear from the earth unless the
      abuses of it practiced in many of the States could be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s services in behalf of the Constitution in the closely 
			fought battle for ratification which took place in the Virginia Convention 
			are only partially disclosed in the pages of Elliot&rsquo;s 
			<i>Debates.</i> He was already coming to be regarded as one excellent in 
			council as well as in formal discussion, and his democratic manners and 
			personal popularity with all classes were a pronounced asset for any 
			cause he chose to espouse. Marshall&rsquo;s part on the floor of the 
			Convention was, of course, much less conspicuous 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>		
			than that of either Madison or Randolph, but in the second rank of the 
			Constitution&rsquo;s defenders, including men like Corbin, Nicholas,
      and Pendleton, he stood foremost. His remarks were naturally shaped first
      of all to meet the immediate necessities of the occasion, but now and then
      they foreshadow views of a more enduring value. For example, he met a
      favorite contention of the opposition by saying that arguments based on
      the assumption that necessary powers would be abused were arguments
      against government in general and &ldquo;a recommendation of 
			anarchy.&rdquo; To Henry&rsquo;s despairing cry that the proposed system 
			lacked checks, he replied: &ldquo;What has become of his enthusiastic 
			eulogium of the American spirit? We should find a check and control, when 
			oppressed, from that source. In this country there is no exclusive 
			personal stock of interest. The interest of the community is blended and 
			inseparably connected with that of the individual.&hellip; When we consult 
			the common good, we consult our own.&rdquo; And when Henry argued that a 
			vigorous union was unnecessary because &ldquo;we are separated by the sea 
			from the powers of Europe,&rdquo; Marshall replied: &ldquo;Sir,
      the sea makes them neighbors of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>		
      It is worthy of note that Marshall gave his greatest attention to the
      judiciary article as it appeared in the proposed Constitution. He pointed
      out that the principle of judicial independence was here better
      safeguarded than in the Constitution of Virginia. He stated in one breath
      the principle of judicial review and the doctrine of enumerated powers.
      If, said he, Congress &ldquo;make a law not warranted by any of the powers
      enumerated, it would be considered by the judges as an infringement of the
      Constitution which they are to guard; they would not consider such a law
      as coming within their jurisdiction. They would declare it void.&rdquo; 
			&sup1; On the other hand, Marshall scoffed at the idea that the citizen of 
			a State might bring an original action against another State in the 
			Supreme Court. His dissections of Mason&rsquo;s and Henry&rsquo;s 
			arguments frequently exhibit controversial skill of a high order. From 
			Henry, indeed, Marshall drew a notable tribute to his talent, which was 
			at the same time proof of his ability to keep friends with his enemies.

      On the day the great Judiciary Act became law, Marshall attained his
      thirty-fourth year. His stride toward professional and political
      prominence was now rapid. At the same time his private interests were
      becoming more closely interwoven with his political principles and
      personal affiliations, and his talents were maturing. Hitherto his outlook
      upon life had been derived largely from older men, but his own
      individuality now began to assert itself; his groove in life was taking
      final shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best description of Marshall shows him in the prime of his manhood a
      few months after his accession to the Supreme Bench. It appears in William
      Wirt&rsquo;s celebrated <i>Letters of the British Spy</i>:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noident">
      The [Chief Justice] of the United States is, in his person, tall, meager,
      emaciated; his muscles relaxed, and his joints so loosely connected, as
      not only to disqualify him, apparently for any vigorous exertion of body,
      but to destroy everything like elegance and harmony in his air and
      movements. Indeed, in his whole appearance, and demeanour; dress,
      attitudes, gesture; sitting, standing or walking; he is as far removed
      from the idolized graces of Lord Chesterfield, as any other gentleman on
      earth. To continue the portrait: his head and face are small in proportion
      to his height; his complexion swarthy; the muscles of his face, being
      relaxed, give him the appearance of a man of fifty years of age, nor can
      he be much younger; his countenance has a faithful expression of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>	
			great good humour and hilarity; while his black eyes&mdash;that unerring 
			index&mdash;possess an irradiating spirit, which proclaims the imperial 
			powers of the mind that sits enthroned within.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;British Spy&rdquo; then describes Marshall&rsquo;s personality 
			as an orator at the time when he was still practicing at the Virginia bar:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      His voice [the description continues] is dry and hard; his attitude, in
      his most effective orations, was often extremely awkward, as it was not
      unusual for him to stand with his left foot in advance, while all his
      gestures proceeded from his right arm, and consisted merely in a vehement,
      perpendicular swing of it from about the elevation of his head to the bar,
      behind which he was accustomed to stand.&hellip; [Nevertheless] if 
			eloquence may be said to consist in the power of seizing the attention 
			with irresistible force, and never permitting it to elude the grasp until 
			the hearer has received the conviction which the speaker intends, [then] 
			this extraordinary man, without the aid of fancy, without the advantages 
			of person, voice, attitude, gesture, or any of the ornaments of an orator,
      deserves to be considered as one of the most eloquent men in the 
			world.&hellip; He possesses one original, and, almost, supernatural 
			faculty; the faculty of developing a subject by a single glance of his 
			mind, and detecting at once, the very point on which every controversy 
			depends. No matter what the question; though ten times more knotty than 
			the gnarled oak, the lightning of heaven is not more rapid nor more 
			resistless, than his astonishing penetration. Nor does 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>	
			the exercise of it seem to cost him an effort. On the contrary, it is as 
			easy as vision. I am persuaded that his eyes do not fly over a landscape 
			and take in its various objects with more promptitude and facility, than 
			his mind embraces and analyzes the most complex subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessing while at the bar this intellectual elevation, which enables
      him to look down and comprehend the whole ground at once, he determined
      immediately and without difficulty, on which side the question might be
      most advantageously approached and assailed. In a bad cause his art
      consisted in laying his premises so remotely from the point directly in
      debate, or else in terms so general and so spacious, that the hearer,
      seeing no consequence which could be drawn from them, was just as willing
      to admit them as not; but his premises once admitted, the demonstration,
      however distant, followed as certainly, as cogently, as inevitably, as any
      demonstration in Euclid.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his eloquence consists in the apparently deep self-conviction, and
      emphatic earnestness of his manner, the correspondent simplicity and
      energy of his style; the close and logical connexion of his thoughts; and
      the easy gradations by which he opens his lights on the attentive minds of
      his hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience are never permitted to pause for a moment. There is no
      stopping to weave garlands of flowers, to hang in festoons, around a
      favorite argument. On the contrary, every sentence is progressive; every
      idea sheds new light on the subject; the listener is kept perpetually in
      that sweetly pleasurable vibration, with which the mind of man always
      receives new truths; the dawn advances in easy but unremitting pace; the
      subject opens gradually on the view; until, rising in high 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>	
			relief, in all its native colors and proportions, the argument is 
			consummated by the conviction of the delighted hearer.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      What appeared to Marshall&rsquo;s friends as most likely in his early 
			middle years to stand in the way of his advancement was his addiction to 
			ease and to a somewhat excessive conviviality. But it is worth noting that 
			the charge of conviviality was never repeated after he was appointed Chief
      Justice; and as to his unstudious habits, therein perhaps lay one of the
      causes contributing to his achievement. Both as attorney and as judge, he
      preferred the quest of broad, underlying principles, and, with plenty of
      time for recuperation from each exertion, he was able to bring to each
      successive task undiminished vitality and unclouded attention. What the
      author of the <i>Leviathan</i> remarks of himself may well be 
			repeated of Marshall&mdash;that he made more use of his brains than of his 
			bookshelves and that, if he had read as much as most men, he would have 
			been as ignorant as they.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Marshall was one of the leading members of his profession in
      Virginia, the most recent biographical researches unmistakably prove.
      &ldquo;From 1790 until his election to Congress nine years 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>	
			later,&rdquo; Albert J. Beveridge &sup1; writes, &ldquo;Marshall argued 
			113 cases decided by the court of appeals of Virginia.&hellip; He 
			appeared during this time in practically every important cause heard and 
			determined by the supreme tribunal of the State.&rdquo; Practically all 
			this litigation concerned property rights, and much of it was exceedingly 
			intricate. Marshall&rsquo;s biographer also points out the interesting 
			fact that &ldquo;whenever there was more than one attorney for the client 
			who retained Marshall, the latter almost invariably was retained to make 
			the closing argument.&rdquo; He was thus able to make good any
      lack of knowledge of the technical issues involved as well as to bring his
      great debating powers to bear with the best advantage.
    </p>

				&sup1;  <i>The Life of John Marshall,</i> vol. II, p. 177.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Marshall was also rising into political prominence. From the 
			first a supporter of Washington&rsquo;s Administration, he was gradually 
			thrust into the position of Federalist leader in Virginia. In 1794 he 
			declined the post of Attorney-General, which Washington had offered him. 
			In the following year he became involved in the acrimonious struggle over 
			the Jay Treaty with Great Britain, and both in the Legislature and before 
			meetings of citizens defended the treaty so aggressively that its 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>	
			opponents were finally forced to abandon their contention that it was 
			unconstitutional and to content themselves with a simple denial that it 
			was expedient. Early in 1796 Marshall made his first appearance before the 
			Supreme Court, in the case of Ware <i>vs.</i> Hylton. The fame of his 
			defense of &ldquo;the British Treaty&rdquo; during the previous 
			year had preceded him, and his reception by the Federalist leaders from 
			New York and New England was notably cordial. His argument before the 
			Court, too, though it did not in the end prevail, added greatly to his 
			reputation. &ldquo;His head,&rdquo; said Rufus King, who heard
      the argument, &ldquo;is one of the best organized of any one that I 
			have known.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Either in 1793 or early in the following year, Marshall participated in a
      business transaction which, though it did not impart to his political and
      constitutional views their original bent, yet must have operated more or
      less to confirm his opinions. A syndicate composed of Marshall, one of his
      brothers, and two other gentlemen, purchased from the British heirs what
      remained of the great Fairfax estate in the Northern Neck, a tract
      &ldquo;embracing over 160,000 acres of the best land in Virginia.&rdquo; 
			By an Act passed during the Revolution, Virginia had decreed the 
			confiscation of all lands held by 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>	
			British subjects; and though the State had never prosecuted the 
			forfeiture of this particular estate, she was always threatening to do
      so. Marshall&rsquo;s investment thus came to occupy for many years a 
			precarious legal footing which, it may be surmised, did not a little to 
			keep alert his natural sympathy for all victims of legislative oppression. 
			Moreover the business relation which he formed with Robert Morris in 
			financing the investment brought him into personal contact for the first 
			time with the interests behind Hamilton&rsquo;s financial program, the 
			constitutionality of which he had already defended on the hustings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was due also to this business venture that Marshall was at last
      persuaded to break through his rule of declining office and to accept
      appointment in 1797, together with Pinckney and Gerry, on the famous
      &ldquo;X.Y.Z.&rdquo; mission to France. From this single year&rsquo;s 
			employment he obtained nearly $20,000, which, says his biographer, 
			&ldquo;over and above his expenses,&rdquo; was &ldquo;three times his 
			annual earnings at the bar&rdquo;; and the money came just in the nick 
			of time to save the Fairfax investment, for Morris was now
      bankrupt and in jail. But not less important as a result of his services
      was the enhanced reputation which Marshall&rsquo;s correspondence 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>	
			with Talleyrand brought him. His return to Philadelphia was a popular 
			triumph, and even Jefferson, temporarily discomfited by the 
			&ldquo;X.Y.Z.&rdquo; disclosures, found it discreet to go through the 
			form of paying him court&mdash;whereby hangs a tale. Jefferson called at 
			Marshall&rsquo;s tavern. Marshall was out. Jefferson thereupon left a 
			card deploring how &ldquo;unlucky&rdquo; he had been. Commenting years 
			afterwards upon the occurrence, Marshall remarked that this was one time 
			at least when Jefferson came <em>near</em> telling the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the warm insistence of Washington, Marshall was finally persuaded
      in the spring of 1799 to stand as Federalist candidate for Congress in the
      Richmond district. The expression of his views at this time is
      significant. A correspondent of an Alexandria newspaper signing himself
      &ldquo;Freeholder&rdquo; put to him a number of questions intended to call 
			forth Marshall&rsquo;s opinions on the issues of the day. In answering a 
			query as to whether he favored an alliance with Great Britain, the 
			candidate declared that the whole of his &ldquo;politics respecting 
			foreign nations&rdquo; was &ldquo;reducible to this single 
			position.&hellip; Commercial intercourse with all, but political
      ties with none.&rdquo; But a more pressing issue on which the public 
			wished information was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>	
			that furnished by the Alien and Sedition laws, which Marshall had 
			originally criticized on grounds both of expediency and of
      constitutionality. Now, however, he defended these measures on
      constitutional grounds, taking the latitudinarian position that 
			&ldquo;powers necessary for the attainment of all objects which are 
			general in their nature, which interest all America &hellip; would be 
			naturally vested in the Government of the whole,&rdquo; but he declared 
			himself strongly opposed to their renewal. At the same time he denounced 
			the Virginia Resolutions as calculated &ldquo;to sap the foundations of 
			our Union.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The election was held late in April, under conditions which must have
      added greatly to popular interest. Following the custom in Virginia, the
      voter, instead of casting a ballot, merely declared his preference in the
      presence of the candidates, the election officials, and the assembled
      multitude. In the intensity of the struggle no voter, halt, lame, or
      blind, was overlooked; and a barrel of whisky near at hand lent further
      zest to the occasion. Time and again the vote in the district was a tie,
      and as a result frequent personal encounters took place between aroused
      partisans. Marshall&rsquo;s election by a narrow majority in a borough 
			which was strongly 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
			pro-Jeffersonian was due, indeed, not to his principles but to
      his personal popularity and to the support which he received from Patrick
      Henry, the former Governor of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most notable event of his brief stay in Congress was his successful
      defense of President Adams&rsquo;s action in handing over to the British
      authorities, in conformity with the twenty-seventh article of the Jay
      treaty, Jonathan Robins, who was alleged to be a fugitive from justice.
      Adams&rsquo;s critics charged him with having usurped a judicial function. 
			&ldquo;The President,&rdquo; said Marshall in reply, &ldquo;is sole organ 
			of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with 
			foreign nations. Of consequence, the demand of a foreign nation can only 
			be made on him. He possesses the whole executive power. He holds and 
			directs the force of the nation. Of consequence, any act to be performed 
			by the force of the nation is to be performed through him. He is charged 
			to execute the laws. A treaty is declared to be a law. He must then 
			execute a treaty where he, and he alone, possesses the means of executing 
			it.&rdquo; This is one of the few speeches ever uttered on the floor of 
			Congress which demonstrably made votes. Gallatin, who had been set to 
			answer Marshall, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
			threw up his brief; and the resolutions against the President were 
			defeated by a House hostile to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s course in Congress was characterized throughout by 
			independence of character, moderation of views, and level good sense, of 
			which his various congressional activities afford abundant evidence. 
			Though he had himself been one of the &ldquo;X.Y.Z.&rdquo; mission, 
			Marshall now warmly supported Adams&rsquo;s policy of renewing diplomatic 
			relations with France. He took his political life in his hands to register 
			a vote against the Sedition Act, a proposal to repeal which was brought 
			before the House. He foiled a scheme which his party associates had 
			devised, in view of the approaching presidential election, to transfer to 
			a congressional committee the final authority in canvassing the electoral 
			vote&mdash;a plan all too likely to precipitate civil war. His Federalist 
			brethren of the extreme Hamiltonian type quite resented the frequency with 
			which he was wont to kick over the party traces. &ldquo;He is 
			disposed,&rdquo; wrote Sedgwick, the Speaker, &ldquo;to express
      great respect for the sovereign people and to quote their opinions as an
      evidence of truth,&rdquo; which &ldquo;is of all things the most 
			destructive of personal independence and of that weight of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
			character which a great man
      ought to possess.&rdquo; &sup1;

      Marshall had now come to be practically indispensable to the isolated
      President, at whose most earnest insistence he entered the Cabinet as
      Secretary of State, though he had previously declined to become Secretary
      of War. The presidential campaign was the engrossing interest of the year,
      and as it spread its &ldquo;havoc of virulence&rdquo; throughout the 
			country, Federalists of both factions seemed to turn to Marshall in the 
			hope that, by some miracle of conciliation, he could save the day. The 
			hope proved groundless, however, and all that was ultimately left the 
			party which had founded the Government was to choose a President from the 
			rival leaders of the opposition. Of these Marshall preferred Burr, 
			because, as he explained, he knew Jefferson&rsquo;s principles better. 
			Besides having foreign prejudices, Mr. Jefferson, he continued, 
			&ldquo;appears to me to be a man who will embody himself with the House of 
			Representatives, and by weakening the office of President, he will 
			increase his personal power.&rdquo; Better political prophecy has, indeed, 
			rarely been penned. Deferring nevertheless to Hamilton&rsquo;s 
			insistence&mdash;and, as events were to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
			prove, to his superior wisdom&mdash;Marshall kept aloof from the fight 
			in the House, and his implacable foe was elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall was already one of the eminent men of the country when Adams,
      without consulting him, nominated him for Chief Justice. He stood at the
      head of the Virginia bar; he was the most generally trusted leader of his
      party; he already had a national reputation as an interpreter of the
      Constitution. Yet his appointment as Chief Justice aroused criticism even
      among his party friends. Their doubt did not touch his intellectual
      attainments, but in their opinion his political moderation, his essential
      democracy, his personal amiability, all counted against him. &ldquo;He 
			is,&rdquo; wrote Sedgwick, &ldquo;a man of very affectionate disposition, 
			of great simplicity of manners, and honest and honorable in all his 
			conduct. He is attached to pleasures, with convivial habits strongly 
			fixed. He is indolent therefore. He has a strong attachment to popularity 
			but is indisposed to sacrifice to it his integrity; hence he is disposed 
			on all popular subjects to feel the public pulse, and hence results 
			indecision and <em>an expression</em> of doubt.&rdquo; &sup1;

      It was perhaps fortunate for the Federal Judiciary, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
			of which he was now to take command, that John Marshall was on occasion 
			&ldquo;disposed &hellip; to feel the public pulse.&rdquo; A 
			headstrong pilot might speedily have dashed his craft on the rocks; a 
			timid one would have abandoned his course; but Marshall did neither. The 
			better answer to Sedgwick&rsquo;s fears was given in 1805 when John
      Randolph declared that Marshall&rsquo;s &ldquo;real worth was never 
			known until he was appointed Chief Justice.&rdquo; And Sedgwick is 
			further confuted by the portraits of the Chief Justice, which, with all 
			their diversity, are in accord on that stubborn chin, that firm placid 
			mouth, that steady, benignant gaze, so capable of putting attorneys out 
			of countenance when they had to face it overlong. Here are the lineaments 
			of self-confidence unmarred by vanity, of dignity without condescension,

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">By</span> a singular coincidence Marshall took his 
			seat as Chief Justice at the opening of the first term of Court in 
			Washington, the new capital, on Wednesday, February 4, 1801. The most 
			beautiful of capital cities was then little more than a swamp, athwart 
			which ran a streak of mire named by solemn congressional enactment 
			&ldquo;Pennsylvania Avenue.&rdquo; At one end of this
      difficult thoroughfare stood the President&rsquo;s mansion&mdash;still in 
			the hands of the builders but already sagging and leaking through the
      shrinkage of the green timber they had used&mdash;two or three partially
      constructed office-buildings, and a few private edifices and boarding
      houses. Marshall never removed his residence to Washington but occupied
      chambers in one or other of these buildings, in company with some of the
      associate justices. This arrangement was practicable owing to the brevity
      of the judicial term, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
			which usually lasted little more than six weeks, and
      was almost necessitated by the unhealthful climate of the place. It may be
      conjectured that the life of John Marshall was prolonged for some years by
      the Act of 1802, which abolished the August term of court, for in the late
      summer and early autumn the place swarmed with mosquitoes and reeked with
      malaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capitol, which stood at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, was in
      1801 even less near completion than the President&rsquo;s house; at this 
			time the south wing rose scarcely twenty feet above its foundations. In the
      north wing, which was nearer completion, in a basement chamber, approached
      by a small hall opening on the eastern side of the Capitol and flanked by
      pillars carved to represent bundles of cornstalks with ears half opened at
      the top, Marshall held court for more than a third of a century and
      elaborated his great principles of constitutional law. This room,
      untouched by British vandalism in the invasion of 1814, was christened by
      the witty malignity of John Randolph, &ldquo;the cave of Trophonius.&rdquo; 
			&sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">

        <a id="footer_54-1" name="footer_54-1"></a>
				&sup1;  It should, however, be noted in the interest of accuracy, that
				the Court does not seem to have occupied its basement chamber during the
				years 1814 to 1818, while the Capitol was under repair.

      It was in the Senate Chamber in this same north wing that Marshall
      administered the oath of office to Jefferson just one month after he
      himself had taken office. There have been in American history few more
      dramatic moments, few more significant, than this occasion when these two
      men confronted each other. They detested each other with a detestation
      rooted in the most essential differences of character and outlook. As good
      fortune arranged it, however, each came to occupy precisely that political
      station in which he could do his best work and from which he could best
      correct the bias of the other. Marshall&rsquo;s nationalism rescued 
			American democracy from the vaguer horizons to which Jefferson&rsquo;s 
			cosmopolitanism beckoned, and gave to it a secure abode with plenty of 
			elbow-room. Jefferson&rsquo;s emphasis on the right of the contemporary 
			majority to shape its own institutions prevented Marshall&rsquo;s 
			constitutionalism from developing a privileged aristocracy. Marshall was 
			finely loyal to principles accepted from others; Jefferson was 
			speculative, experimental; the personalities of these two men did much to 
			conserve essential values in the American Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jefferson turned from his oath-taking to deliver his inaugural,
      Marshall must have listened 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
			with attentive ears for some hint of the
      attitude which the new Administration proposed to take with regard to the
      Federal Judiciary and especially with regard to the recent act increasing
      its numbers; but if so, he got nothing for his pains. The new President
      seemed particularly bent upon dispelling any idea that there was to be a
      political proscription. Let us, said he, &ldquo;unite with one heart and 
			one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection
      without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things.&hellip; 
			Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have 
			called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all 
			Republicans, we are all Federalists.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the reassurance of these words, the atmosphere both of
      official Washington and of the country at large was electric with
      dangerous currents&mdash;dangerous especially to judges&mdash;and
      Jefferson was far too well known as an adept in the manipulation of
      political lightning to admit of much confidence that he would fail to turn
      these forces against his enemy when the opportune moment should arrive.
      The national courts were regarded with more distrust by the mass of
      Republicans than any other part of the hated system 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
			created by the once dominant Federalists. The reasons why this was so have 
			already been indicated, but the most potent reason in 1801, because it was 
			still freshest in mind, was the domineering part which the national judges 
			had played in the enforcement of the Sedition Act. The terms of this 
			illiberal measure made, and were meant to make, criticism of the party in 
			power dangerous. The judges&mdash;Federalists to a man and bred, moreover, 
			in a tradition which ill distinguished the office of judge from that of
      prosecutor&mdash;felt little call to mitigate the lot of those who fell 
			within the toils of the law under this Act. A shining mark for the 
			Republican enemies of the Judiciary was Justice Samuel Chase of the 
			Supreme Court. It had fallen to Chase&rsquo;s lot to preside successively 
			at the trial of Thomas Cooper for sedition, at the second trial of John 
			Fries for treason, and at the trial of James Thompson Callender at 
			Richmond for sedition. On each of the two latter occasions the 
			defendant&rsquo;s counsel, charging &ldquo;oppressive 
			conduct&rdquo; on the part of the presiding judge, had thrown up 
			their briefs and rushed from the court room. In 1800 there were few 
			Republicans who did not regard Chase as &ldquo;the bloody 
			Jeffreys of America.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
      Local conditions also frequently accentuated the prevailing prejudice
      against the Judiciary. The people of Kentucky, afraid that their badly
      tangled land titles were to be passed upon by the new Federal Courts, were
      already insisting, when Jefferson took office, that the Act of the 13th of
      February creating these courts be repealed. In Maryland extensive and
      radical alterations of the judicial system of the State were pending. In
      Pennsylvania the situation was even more serious, for though the judges of
      the higher courts of that commonwealth were usually men of ability,
      education, and character, the inferior magistrates were frequently the
      very opposite. By the state constitution judges were removable for serious
      offenses by impeachment, and for lesser reasons by the Governor upon the
      address of two-thirds of both branches of the Legislature. So long,
      however, as the Federalists had remained in power neither remedy had been
      applied; but in 1799, when the Republicans had captured both the
      governorship and the Legislature, a much needed purgation of the lower
      courts had forthwith begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately this is a sort of reform that grows by what it feeds upon.
      Having got rid of the less fit members of the local judiciary, the
      Republican 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
			leaders next turned their attention to some of their aggressive
      party foes on the Superior Bench. The most offensive of these was
      Alexander Addison, president of one of the Courts of Common Pleas of the
      State. He had started life as a Presbyterian preacher and had found it
      natural to add to his normal judicial duties the business of inculcating
      &ldquo;sound morals and manners.&rdquo; &sup1; Addison had at once taken 
			the Alien and Sedition laws under his wing, though their enforcement did 
			not fall within his jurisdiction, and he found in the progress of the 
			French Revolution numerous texts for partisan harangues to county juries. 
			For some reason Addison&rsquo;s enemies decided to resort to impeachment 
			rather than to removal by address; and, as a result, in January, 1803, the 
			State Senate found him guilty of &ldquo;misdemeanor,&rdquo; ordered his 
			removal from office, and disqualified him for judicial office in 
			Pennsylvania. Not long afterwards the House of Representatives granted 
			without inquiry or discussion a petition to impeach three members of the 
			Supreme Court of the State for having
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
      punished one Thomas Passmore for contempt of court without a jury trial.

      Jefferson entered office with his mind made up that the Act of the 13th of
      February should be repealed. &sup1; He lacked only a theory whereby he 
			could reconcile this action with the Constitution, and that was soon
      forthcoming. According to the author of this theory, John Taylor of
      Caroline, a budding &ldquo;Doctor Irrefragabilis&rdquo; of the State 
			Rights school, the proposed repeal raised two questions: first, whether 
			Congress could
      abolish courts created by a previous act of Congress; and second, whether,
      with such courts abolished, their judges still retained office. Addressing
      himself to the first question, Taylor pointed out that the Act of the 13th
      of February had itself by instituting a new system abolished the then
      existing inferior courts. As to the second point, he wrote thus: 
			&ldquo;The Constitution declares that the judge shall hold his office 
			during good behavior. Could it mean that he should hold office after it 
			had been abolished? Could it mean that his tenure should be limited by 
			behaving well in an office which did not exist?&rdquo; A 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
			construction based on such absurdities, said he, &ldquo;overturns the 
			benefits of language and intellect.&rdquo;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_61-1" name="footer_61-1"></a>
				&sup1; In this connection Mr. Beveridge draws my attention to
				Jefferson&rsquo;s letter to A. Stuart of April 5, 1801. See the 
				<i>Complete Works of Jefferson</i> (Washington, 1857), vol. IV, p. 393.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      In his message of December 8, 1801, Jefferson gave the signal for the
      repeal of the obnoxious measure, and a month later Breckinridge of
      Kentucky introduced the necessary resolution in the Senate. In the
      prolonged debate which followed, the Republicans in both Senate and House
      rang the changes on Taylor&rsquo;s argument. The Federalists made a 
			twofold answer. Some, accepting the Republican premise that the fate of 
			the judge was necessarily involved with that of the court, denied 
			<i>in toto</i> the validity of repeal. Gouverneur Morris, for instance, 
			said: &ldquo;You shall not take the man from the office but you may take 
			the office from the man; you may not drown him, but you may sink his boat 
			under him.&hellip; Is this not absurd?&rdquo; Other Federalists, however, 
			were ready to admit that courts of statutory origin could be abolished by 
			statute but added that the operation of Congress&rsquo;s power in this 
			connection was limited by the plain requirement of the Constitution that 
			judges of the United States should hold office during good behavior. 
			Hence, though a valid repeal of the Act in question would take from the 
			judges the powers which they derived from its provisions, the repeal 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
			would still leave them judges of the United
      States until they died, resigned, or were legally removed in consequence
      of impeachment. The Federalist orators in general contended that the
      spirit of the Constitution confirmed its letter, and that its intention
      was clear that the national judges should pass finally upon the
      constitutionality of acts of Congress and should therefore be as secure as
      possible from legislative molestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repeal of this Act was voted by a strict party majority and was
      re&euml;nforced by a provision postponing the next session of the Supreme 
			Court until the following February. The Republican leaders evidently hoped 
			that by that time all disposition to test the validity of the Repealing 
			Act in the Court would have passed. But by this very precaution they 
			implied a recognition of the doctrine of judicial review and the whole 
			trend of the debate abundantly confirmed this implication. Breckinridge, 
			Randolph, and Giles, it is true, scouted the claim made for the courts as 
			&ldquo;unheard-of doctrine,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;mockery of the 
			high powers of legislation&rdquo;; but the rank and file of their 
			followers, with the excesses of the French Revolution a recent memory 
			and a &ldquo;consolidated government&rdquo; a recent fear,
      were not to be seduced from what they clearly 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
			regarded as established
      doctrine. Moreover, when it came to legislation concerning the Supreme
      Court, the majority of the Republicans again displayed genuine moderation,
      for, thrusting aside an obvious temptation to swamp that tribunal with
      additional judges of their own creed, they merely restored it to its
      original size under the Act of 1789.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the most significant aspect in the repeal of the Act of the
      13th of February was the fact itself. The Republicans had not shown a more
      flagrant partisanism in effecting this repeal than had the Federalists in
      originally enacting the measure which was now at an end. Though the
      Federalists had sinned first, the fact nevertheless remained that in
      realizing their purpose the Republican majority had established a
      precedent which threatened to make of the lower Federal Judiciary the
      merest cat&rsquo;s-paw of party convenience. The attitude of the 
			Republican leaders was even more menacing, for it touched the security of 
			the Supreme Court itself in the enjoyment of its highest prerogative and 
			so imperiled the unity of the nation. Beyond any doubt the moment was now 
			at hand when the Court must prove to its supporters that it was still 
			worth defending and to all that the Constitution had an authorized final 
			interpreter.

      Marshall&rsquo;s first constitutional case was that of Marbury <i>vs.</i> 
			Madison. &sup1; The facts of this famous litigation are simple. On March 
			2, 1801, William Marbury had been nominated by President Adams to the 
			office of Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia for five 
			years; his nomination had been ratified by the Senate; his commission 
			had been signed and sealed; but it had not yet been delivered when 
			Jefferson took office. The new President ordered Madison, his Secretary 
			of State, not to deliver the commission. Marbury then applied to the 
			Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to the Secretary of State under the 
			supposed authorization of the thirteenth section of the Act of 1789, which 
			empowered the Court to issue the writ &ldquo;in cases warranted by the 
			principles and usages of law to &hellip; persons holding office under the 
			authority of the United States.&rdquo; The Court at first took

    <p>
      Such are the lawyer&rsquo;s facts of the case; it is the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
			historian&rsquo;s facts about it which are today the interesting and 
			instructive ones. Marshall, reversing the usual order of procedure, left 
			the question of jurisdiction
      till the very last, and so created for himself an opportunity to lecture
      the President on his duty to obey the law and to deliver the commission.
      Marshall based his homily on the questionable assumption that the
      President had not the power to remove Marbury from office, for if he had
      this power the nondelivery of the document was of course immaterial.
      Marshall&rsquo;s position was equally questionable when he contended that 
			the thirteenth section violated that clause of Article III of the 
			Constitution which gives the Supreme Court original jurisdiction 
			&ldquo;in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and 
			consuls, and those in which a State shall be party.&rdquo; These words, 
			urged the Chief Justice, must be given an exclusive sense &ldquo;or they 
			have no operation at all.&rdquo; This position is quite untenable, for 
			even when given only their affirmative value these words still place the 
			cases enumerated beyond the reach of Congress, and this may have been 
			their only purpose. However, granting the Chief Justice his view of 
			Article III, still we are not forced to challenge the validity of what 
			Congress had done. For the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
			view taken a
      little later by the Court was that it was not the intention of Congress by
      this language to confer any jurisdiction at all, but only to give the
      right to issue the writ where the jurisdiction already existed. What the
      Court should have done, allowing its view of Article III to have been
      correct, was to dismiss the case as not falling within the contemplation
      of section thirteen, and not on the ground of the unconstitutionality of
      that section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison was a political 
			<i>coup</i> of the first magnitude, and by it he achieved half a dozen 
			objects, some of the greatest importance. In the first place, while 
			avoiding a direct collision with the executive power, he stigmatized his 
			enemy Jefferson as a violator of the laws which as President he was 
			sworn to support. Again, he evaded the perilous responsibility of 
			passing upon the validity of the recent Repeal Act in quo warranto 
			proceedings, such as were then being broached. &sup1; For if the Supreme 
			Court could not 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
			issue the writ of mandamus in suits begun in it by individuals, neither 
			could it issue the writ of quo warranto in such suits. Yet again Marshall 
			scored in exhibiting the Court in the edifying and reassuring light of 
			declining, even from the hands of Congress, jurisdiction to which it was 
			not entitled by the Constitution, an attitude of self-restraint which 
			emphasized tremendously the Court&rsquo;s claim to the function of 
			judicial review, now first definitely registered in deliberate judicial 
			decision.

				&sup1; See Benton&rsquo;s <i>Abridgment of the Debates of Congress,</i> 
				vol. II, pp. 665-68. Marshall expressed the opinion in private that the 
				repealing act was &ldquo;operative in depriving the judges of all power 
				derived from the act repealed&rdquo; but not their office, &ldquo;which 
				is a mere capacity, without new appointment, to receive and exercise

				IX, p. 528.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      At this point in Marshall&rsquo;s handling of the case the consummate 
			debater came to the assistance of the political strategist. Every one of 
			his arguments in this opinion in support of judicial review will be found
      anticipated in the debate on the Repeal Act. What Marshall did was to
      gather these arguments together, winnow them of their trivialities,
      inconsistencies, and irrelevancies, and compress the residuum into a
      compact presentation of the case which marches to its conclusion with all
      the precision of a demonstration from Euclid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salient passages of this part of his opinion are the following:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      [In the United States] the powers of the legislature are defined and
      limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the
      Constitution is written. To 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
			what purpose are powers limited, and to what
      purpose is that limitation committed in writing if these limits may, at
      any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction
      between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if
      those limits do not confine the persons on which they are imposed, and if
      acts prohibited and acts allowed are of equal obligation. It is a
      proposition too plain to be contested: that the Constitution controls any
      legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter the
      Constitution by an ordinary act.
    </p>
    <p>
      [If, then,] an act of the legislature, repugnant to the Constitution, is
      void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige
      them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it
      constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to
      overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at first
      view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive
      a more attentive consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to
      say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of
      necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each
      other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. So if a law be in
      opposition to the Constitution; if both the law and the Constitution apply
      to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case
      conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to
      the Constitution, disregarding the law, the court must determine which of
      these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of
      judicial duty.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
      [However, there are those who maintain] that courts must close their eyes
      on the Constitution, and see only the law.&hellip; This doctrine would 
			subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions. It would declare 
			that an act which, according to the principles and theory of our 
			government, is entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely obligatory. 
			It would declare that if the legislature shall do what is expressly 
			forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition, is in 
			reality effectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Moreover,] the peculiar expressions of the Constitution of the United
      States furnish additional arguments in favor of its rejection. The
      judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under
      the Constitution. Could it be the intention of those who gave this power,
      to say that in using it the Constitution should not be looked into? That a
      case arising under the Constitution should be decided without examining
      the instrument under which it arises? This is too extravagant to be
      maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, then, the Constitution must be looked into by the judges.
      And if they can open it at all, what part of it are they forbidden to read
      or to obey? There are many other parts of the Constitution which serve to
      illustrate this subject.&hellip; &ldquo;No person,&rdquo; says 
			the Constitution, &ldquo;shall be convicted of treason unless on the 
			testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in 
			open court.&rdquo; Here the language of the Constitution is addressed 
			especially to the courts. It prescribes, directly for them, a rule of 
			evidence not to be departed from. If the legislature should change that 
			rule, and declare one witness, or a confession out of court, sufficient 
			for conviction, must the constitutional principle yield to the 
			legislative act? &hellip;
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
      It is also not entirely unworthy of observation, that in declaring what
      shall be the supreme law of the land, the Constitution itself is first
      mentioned; and not the laws of the United States generally, but those only
      which shall be made in pursuance of the Constitution, have that rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States
      confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all
      written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the Constitution is void;
      and that courts, as well as other departments are bound by that
      instrument.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      There is not a false step in Marshall&rsquo;s argument. It is, for 
			instance, not contended that the language of the Constitution establishes 
			judicial review but only that it &ldquo;confirms and strengthens the 
			principle.&rdquo; Granting the finality of judicial decisions and that 
			they may not be validly disturbed by legislative enactment, the argument 
			is logically conclusive, whatever practical difficulties it may ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning back to the case itself, we ought finally to note how Marshall
      utilized this opportunity to make manifest the newly found solidarity of
      the Court. For the first time in its history the Court was one voice,
      speaking through its Chief Justice the ineluctable decrees of the law.
      Ordinarily even Marshall would not have found this achievement an easy
      task, for there were difficult personalities 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
			among his associates. He had
      in Adams&rsquo;s Cabinet demonstrated his faculty &ldquo;of putting his 
			ideas into the minds of others, unconsciously to them,&rdquo; and of this 
			power he now made use, as well as of the advantage to be obtained from the 
			impending common danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison was decided on February 24, 1803, 
			and therefore fell between two other events which were immediately of 
			almost as great importance in the struggle now waxing over the judiciary. 
			The first of these was the impeachment of Judge Pickering of the New 
			Hampshire District Court, which was suggested by the President on the 3d 
			of February and voted by the House on the 18th of February; the other was 
			an address which Justice Chase delivered on the 2d of May to a Baltimore 
			grand jury, assailing the repeal of the Judiciary Act and universal 
			suffrage and predicting the deterioration of &ldquo;our republican 
			Constitution &hellip; into a mobocracy, the worst of all possible 
			governments.&rdquo; &sup1; Considering the fact that the President was 
			still smarting from the Chief Justice&rsquo;s lash and also that Chase 
			himself was more 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
			heartily detested by the Republicans than any other member of the Supreme 
			Bench, nothing could have been more untimely than this fresh judicial 
			excursion into the field of &ldquo;manners and morals,&rdquo; and partisan 
			malice was naturally alert to interpret it as something even more 
			offensive. The report soon came from Baltimore that Chase had deliberately 
			assailed the Administration as &ldquo;weak, pusillanimous, relaxed,&rdquo; 
			and governed by the sole desire of continuing &ldquo;in unfairly acquired 
			power.&rdquo; But even before this intelligence arrived, Jefferson had 
			decided that the opportunity afforded by Chase&rsquo;s outburst
      was too good a one to be neglected. Writing on the 13th of May to
      Nicholson of Maryland, who already had Pickering&rsquo;s impeachment in 
			charge, the President inquired: &ldquo;Ought this seditious and official 
			attack on the principles of our Constitution and the proceedings of a 
			State go unpunished?&rdquo; But he straightway added: &ldquo;The question 
			is for your consideration; for myself it is better I should not 
			interfere.&rdquo;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_72-1" name="footer_72-1"></a>
				&sup1; The account here given of Chase&rsquo;s trial is based on Charles
				Evans&rsquo;s shorthand <i>Report</i> (Baltimore, 1805), supplemented 
				by J.&nbsp;Q. Adams&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>.
    </p>
		</div>

    <p>
      Pickering&rsquo;s trial began on March 2, 1804, and had a bearing on 
			Chase&rsquo;s fate which at once became clear. The evidence against the 
			New Hampshire judge showed intoxication and profanity on the bench and 
			entire unfitness for office, but further 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
			evidence introduced in his behalf 
			proved the defendant&rsquo;s insanity; and so the question at once arose 
			whether an insane man can be guilty of &ldquo;high crimes and 
			misdemeanors?&rdquo; Greatly troubled by this new aspect of the case, the 
			Senate none the less voted Pickering guilty &ldquo;as charged,&rdquo; by 
			the required two-thirds majority, though eight members refused to vote at 
			all. But the exponents of &ldquo;judge-breaking&rdquo; saw only the action 
			of the Senate and were blind to its hesitation. On the same day on which 
			the Senate gave its verdict on Pickering, the House by a strictly partisan 
			vote decreed Chase&rsquo;s impeachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charges against Chase were finally elaborated in eight articles. The
      substance of the first six was that he had been guilty of 
			&ldquo;oppressive conduct&rdquo; at the trials of John Fries and James 
			Thompson Callender. The seventh charged him with having attempted at some 
			time in 1800 to dragoon a grand jury at Newcastle, Delaware, into bringing 
			forward an accusation of sedition against a local paper. These seven 
			articles related therefore to transactions already four or five years old. 
			The eighth article alone was based on the address at Baltimore, which it 
			characterized as &ldquo;an intemperate and inflammatory political 
			harangue,&rdquo; delivered 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
			&ldquo;with intent to excite the fears and 
			resentment &hellip; of the good people of Maryland against their State 
			Government and Constitution, &hellip; and against the Government of the 
			United States.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the charges framed against Chase revealed only imperfectly the animus
      which was now coming more and more to control the impeachers. Fortunately,
      however, there was one man among the President&rsquo;s advisers who was 
			ready to carry the whole antijudicial program as far as possible. This
      uncompromising opponent was William Branch Giles, Senator from Virginia,
      whose views on the subject of impeachment were taken down by John Quincy
      Adams just as Chase&rsquo;s trial was about to open. Giles, according to 
			this record, &ldquo;treated with the utmost contempt the idea of an 
			<em>independent judiciary</em>&mdash;said there was not a word about their 
			independence in the Constitution.&hellip; The power of impeachment was 
			given without limitation to the House 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
			of Representatives; the power of 
			trying impeachment was given equally without limitation to the Senate; and 
			if the Judges of the Supreme Court should dare, as they had done, to 
			declare an act of Congress unconstitutional, or to send a mandamus to the 
			Secretary of State, as they had done, it was the unreserved right of the 
			House of Representatives to impeach them, and that of the Senate to 
			remove them, for giving such opinions, however, honest or sincere they 
			may have been in entertaining them.&rdquo; For &ldquo;impeachment was not 
			a criminal prosecution, it was no prosecution at all.&rdquo; It only 
			signified that the impeached officer held dangerous opinions and that his 
			office ought to be in better hands. &ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; adds Adams, 
			on his own account, &ldquo;that the impeachment system is to be pursued, 
			and the whole bench of the Supreme Court to be swept away, because 
			<em>their offices are wanted.</em> And in the present state of things I am
      convinced it is as easy for Mr. John Randolph and Mr. Giles to do this as
      to say it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial formally opened on January 2, 1805, though the taking of
      testimony did not begin until the 9th of February. A contemporary
      description of the Senate chamber shows that the apostles of Republican
      simplicity, with the pomp of the Warren Hastings trial still fresh in
      mind, were not at all averse to making the scene as impressive as possible
      by the use of several different colors of cloth: &ldquo;On the right and 
			left of the President of the Senate, and in a right line with his chair, 
			there are two rows of benches with desks in front, and the whole front and 
			seats covered with crimson cloth.&hellip; 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
			A temporary semi-circular 
			gallery, which consists of three ranges of benches, is elevated on pillars 
			and the whole front and seats thereof covered with green cloth.&hellip; 
			In this gallery ladies are accommodated.&hellip; On the right and left 
			hand of the President &hellip; are two boxes of two rows of seats &hellip; 
			that facing the President&rsquo;s right is occupied by the managers 
			&hellip; that on the other side of the bar for the accused and his counsel 
			&hellip; these boxes are covered with blue cloth.&rdquo; To preside over 
			this scene of somewhat dubious splendor came Aaron Burr, Vice-President 
			of the United States, straight from the dueling ground at Weehawken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion brought forward one of the most extraordinary men of the day,
      Luther Martin, Chase&rsquo;s friend and the leader of his counsel. Born at 
			New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1744, Martin graduated from Princeton in 
			1766, the first of a class of thirty-five, among whom was Oliver 
			Ellsworth. Five years later he began to practice law on the Eastern Shore 
			of Maryland and in the adjoining counties of Virginia, where he won an 
			immediate success, especially in criminal cases. At a single term of 
			court, out of thirty defendants he procured the acquittal of twenty-nine, 
			while the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
			thirtieth, indicted for murder, was convicted of manslaughter. In 1805 
			Martin was the acknowledged head of the American Bar, but at the same time 
			he was undoubtedly a drunkard and a spendthrift. With an income of $10,000 
			a year, he was always in need. His mediocre stature, thinning locks, and
      undistinguished features created an impression which was confirmed by his
      slovenly attire and ungrammatical speech, which seemed &ldquo;shackled by 
			a preternatural secretion of saliva.&rdquo; Here, indeed, for ugliness and 
			caustic tongue was &ldquo;the Thersites of the law.&rdquo; Yet once he was 
			roused to action, his great resources made themselves apparent: a memory 
			amounting to genius, a boyish delight in the rough-and-tumble of combat, a 
			wealth of passion, kept in perfect curb till the enemy was already in rout 
			before solid argument and then let loose with destroying effect. This 
			child of nature was governed in his practice of the law less by retainers 
			than by his personal loves and hatreds. Samuel Chase he loved and Thomas 
			Jefferson he hated, and though his acquaintance with criminals had 
			furnished him with a vituperative vocabulary of some amplitude, he 
			considered no other damnation quite so scathing as to call a man 
			&ldquo;as great a scoundrel as Tom Jefferson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
      The impeachers had no one whom they could pit against this 
			&ldquo;unprincipled and impudent Federalist bulldog,&rdquo; as Jefferson 
			called him; and in other ways, too, from the first their lot was not easy. 
			For one thing, they could not agree among themselves as to the proper 
			scope of impeachment under the Constitution. Randolph, the leader of the 
			House managers, and Campbell adhered in essence to Giles&rsquo;s theory. 
			But Rodney and Nicholson, both much abler lawyers, openly disavowed such 
			latitudinarian doctrine. In a general way, their view of the matter may be 
			stated thus: Because judges of the United States are guaranteed 
			continuance in office only during &ldquo;good behavior,&rdquo; and because 
			impeachment is the only method of removal recognized by the Constitution, 
			the &ldquo;high crimes and misdemeanors&rdquo; for which impeachment is 
			the constitutional resource must include all cases of willful misconduct 
			in office, whether indictable or not. This seems sound theory and appears 
			today to be established theory. But sound or not, the managers of the 
			Republicans were not a unit in urging it, while their opponents put 
			forward with confidence and unanimity the theory that &ldquo;high
      crimes and misdemeanors&rdquo; were always indictable offenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      More calamitous still for the accusers of Chase 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
			was the way in which, when the evidence began to come in, the case against 
			him started crumpling at the corners. Lewis, who had been Fries&rsquo;s 
			attorney and whose testimony they had chiefly relied upon to prove the 
			judge&rsquo;s unfairness on that occasion, had not only acknowledged that 
			his memory was &ldquo;not very tenacious&rdquo; after so great a lapse of 
			time but had further admitted that he had really dropped the case because 
			he thought it &ldquo;more likely that the President would pardon him 
			[Fries] after having been convicted without having counsel than if he 
			had.&rdquo; Similarly Hay, whose repeated efforts to bring the question 
			of the constitutionality of the Sedition Act before the jury had caused 
			the rupture between court and counsel in Callender&rsquo;s case, owned 
			that he had entertained &ldquo;but little hopes of doing Callender any
      good&rdquo; but had &ldquo;wished to address the public on the 
			constitutionality of the law.&rdquo; Sensations multiplied on every side. 
			A man named Heath testified that Chase had told the marshal to strike all 
			Democrats from the panel which was to try Callender; whereupon a second 
			witness called to confirm this testimony stated facts which showed the 
			whole story to be a deliberate fabrication. The story that Chase had 
			attacked the Administration at Baltimore was also 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
			substantially disproved by the managers&rsquo; own witnesses. But the 
			climax of absurdity was reached in the fifth and sixth articles of 
			impeachment, which were based on the assumption that an act of Congress 
			had required the procedure in Callender&rsquo;s case to be in accordance 
			with the law of Virginia. In reply to this argument Chase&rsquo;s 
			attorneys quickly pointed out that the statute relied upon applied only 
			to actions between citizens of different States!
    </p>
    <p>
      The final arguments began on the 20th of February. The first speech in
      behalf of Chase was delivered by Joseph Hopkinson, a young Philadelphia
      attorney, whose effort stirred the admiration of Federalists and
      Republicans alike. He dwelt upon &ldquo;the infinite importance&rdquo; of 
      the implications of this case for the future of the Republic, contrasted 
      the frivolity of the charges brought against Chase with the magnitude of 
      the crimes of which Warren Hastings had been accused, and pointed out 
			that, whereas in England only two judges had been impeached in half a 
			century, in America, &ldquo;boasting of its superior purity and 
			virtue,&rdquo; seven judges had been prosecuted within two years. More 
			loosely wrought, but not less effective was Martin&rsquo;s address, the 
			superb climax of a remarkable forensic career! The accusation against 
			Chase 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
			he reduced to a 
			charge of indecorum, and he was ready to admit that the manner of his 
			friend &ldquo;bore a stronger resemblance to that of Lord Thurlow than of 
			Lord Chesterfield,&rdquo; but, said he, our judges ought not to be 
			&ldquo;like the gods of Epicurus lolling upon their beds of down, equally 
			careless whether the laws of their country are obeyed or violated, 
			instead of <em>actively</em> discharging their duties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The closing argument, which fell to the managers, was assigned to
      Randolph. It was an unmitigated disaster for the cause in behalf of which
      it was pronounced. &ldquo;I feel perfectly inadequate to the task of 
			closing this important debate on account of a severe indisposition which 
			I labor under,&rdquo; were Randolph&rsquo;s opening words, but even this 
			prefatory apology gave little warning of the distressing exhibition of 
			incompetence which was to follow. &ldquo;On the reopening of the 
			court,&rdquo; records John Quincy Adams in his <i>Memoirs,</i> &ldquo;he 
			[Randolph] began a speech of about two hours and a half, with as little 
			relation to the subject-matter as possible &hellip; without order, 
			connection, or argument; consisting altogether of the most hackneyed 
			commonplaces of popular declamation, mingled up with panegyrics
      and invectives upon persons, with a few well-expressed ideas, a few
      striking figures, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
			much distortion of face and contortion of body, tears,
      groans and sobs, with occasional pauses for recollection, and continual
      complaints of having lost his notes.&rdquo; So ended the ambition of John
      Randolph of Roanoke to prove himself another Burke!
    </p>
    <p>
      But while their frontal assault on the reason of the court was thus
      breaking down, the impeachers, led by the President, were attempting a
      flank movement on its virtue. They especially distrusted the 
			&ldquo;steadiness&rdquo; of certain New England and New York Senators 
			and hoped to reach the hearts of these gentlemen through Aaron Burr, 
			the Vice-President. Burr had heretofore found himself vested with the 
			r&ocirc;le of Lucifer in the Republican Paradise. Now he found himself 
			suddenly basking in a perpetual sunburst of smiles both from the great 
			central luminary, Jefferson, and his paler satellites, Madison and 
			Gallatin. Invitations to the President&rsquo;s dinners were soon 
			followed by more substantial bribes. Burr&rsquo;s step-son became
      judge of the Superior Court at New Orleans; his brother-in-law, secretary
      to the Louisiana Territory; his intimate friend Wilkinson, its military
      commandant. Then Giles, whose view of impeachment left him utterly
      shameless in the matter, drew up and circulated in the Senate itself a
      petition to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
			the Governor of New Jersey asking him to quash the indictment
      for murder which the Bergen County grand jury had found against Burr as a
      result of the duel with Hamilton. At the same time, an act was passed
      giving the retiring Vice-President the franking privilege for life. In the
      debate Senator Wright of Maryland declared that dueling was justified by
      the example of David and Goliath and that the bill was opposed &ldquo;only
      because <em>our</em> David had slain the Goliath of Federalism.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Burr made any attempt to render the expected <i>quid pro quo</i> 
			for these favors does not appear, but at least if he did, his efforts were
      fruitless. The vote on the impeachment of Chase was taken on the 1st of
      March, and the impeachers were crushingly defeated. On the first article
      they could muster only sixteen votes out of thirty-four; on the second,
      only ten; on the fifth, none; on the sixth, four. Even on the last
      article, where they made their best showing, they were still four votes
      short of the required constitutional majority. When the result of the last
      ballot was announced, Randolph rushed from the Senate chamber to the House
      to introduce a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution,
      requiring that judges of the United States &ldquo;shall be removed by 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
			the
      President on joint address of both Houses of Congress.&rdquo; At the same 
			time Nicholson moved an amendment providing legislative recall for 
			Senators. Thus exasperation was vented and no harm done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile word had come from Philadelphia that the impeachment of the
      State Supreme Court judges had also failed. Here, even more impressively
      than in the case of Chase, had been illustrated that solidarity of Bench
      and Bar which has ever since been such an influential factor in American
      government. The Pennsylvania judge-breakers, failing to induce a single
      reputable member of the Philadelphia bar to aid them, had been obliged to
      go to Delaware, whence they procured C&aelig;sar A. Rodney, one of the 
			House managers against Chase. The two impeachments were thus closely 
			connected and their results were similar. In the first place, it was 
			determined that impeachment was likely to be, in the petulant language of 
			Jefferson, &ldquo;a farce&rdquo; not soon to be used again for partisan 
			purposes. In the second place, it was probable that henceforth, in the 
			Commonwealths as well as in the National Government, political power 
			would be exercised subject to constitutional restraints applied 
			judicially. In the third place, however, the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
			judges would henceforth have to be content with the 
			possession of this magnificent prerogative and dispense with all judicial 
			homilies on &ldquo;manners and morals.&rdquo; It was a fair compromise and 
			has on the whole proved a beneficial one.

		<p class="chaptertitle">The Trial Of Aaron Burr</p>
		
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">When</span>, on March 30, 1807, Colonel Aaron Burr, 
			late Vice-President of the United States, was brought before Chief Justice 
			Marshall in the Eagle Tavern at Richmond on the charge of treason, there 
			began the greatest criminal trial in American history and one of the 
			notable trials in the annals of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Burr Conspiracy&rdquo; still remains after a hundred years an 
			unsolved enigma. Yet whether Burr actually planned treason against the 
			United States in the year of grace 1806 is after all a question of 
			somewhat restricted importance. The essential truth is that he was by 
			nature an adventurer who, in the words of Hamilton, &ldquo;believed all 
			things possible to daring and energy,&rdquo; and that in 1806 he was a 
			bankrupt and a social outcast to boot. Whether, therefore, his grandiose 
			project of an empire on the ruins of Spanish dominion in Mexico involved 
			also 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
			an effort to separate some part of the West from the Union is a 
			question which, if it was ever definitely determined in Burr&rsquo;s own 
			mind, was determined, we may be sure, quite independently of any moral or 
			patriotic considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burr&rsquo;s activities after his term of public office ended in March, 
			1805, were devious, complicated, and purposely veiled, involving many men 
			and spread over a large territory. &sup1; Near Marietta on an island in 
			the Ohio River, Burr came upon Harman Blennerhassett, a genial Irishman 
			living in a luxurious and hospitable mansion which was making a heavy 
			drain upon his already diminished resources. Here Burr, by his charm of 
			manner and engaging conversation, soon won from the simple Irishman his 
			heart and his remaining funds. He also made the island both a convenient 
			rendezvous for his adherents in his ambitious schemes and a starting point 
			for his own extended expeditions, which took him during the latter part of 
			this year to Natchez, Nashville, St. Louis, Vincennes, Cincinnati, and 
			Philadelphia, and back to Washington.
    </p>

				&sup1; An account of the Burr conspiracy will be found in <i>Jefferson
				and his Colleagues,</i> by Allen Johnson (in <i>The Chronicles of 
				America</i>).
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1806 Burr turned westward 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
			a second time and with the assistance of Blennerhassett he began military 
			preparations on the latter&rsquo;s island for a mysterious expedition. 
			On the 29th of July, Burr had dispatched a letter in cipher to Wilkinson, 
			his most important confederate. The precise terms of this document we 
			shall never know, but apparently it contained the most amazing claims of 
			the successful maturing of Burr&rsquo;s scheme: &ldquo;funds had been 
			obtained,&rdquo; &ldquo;English naval protection had been secured,&rdquo; 
			&ldquo;from five hundred to a thousand men&rdquo; would be on the move
      down the Mississippi by the middle of November. Unfortunately for Burr,
      however, Wilkinson was far too expert in the usages of iniquity to be
      taken in by such audacious lying as this. He guessed that the enterprise
      was on the verge of collapse and forthwith made up his mind to abandon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile exaggerated accounts of the size of Burr&rsquo;s following were
      filtering to Washington, together with circumstantial rumors of the
      disloyalty of his designs. Yet for weeks Jefferson did nothing, until late
      in November his alarm was aroused by a letter from Wilkinson, dated the
      21st of October. On the 27th of November the President issued a
      proclamation calling upon all 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
			good citizens to seize &ldquo;sundry 
			persons&rdquo; who were charged with setting on foot a military expedition 
			against Spain. Already Burr, realizing that the West was not so hot for 
			disunion as perhaps he had supposed it to be, began to represent his 
			project as a peaceful emigration to the Washita, a precaution which, 
			however, came too late to allay the rising excitement of the people. 
			Fearing the seizure of their equipment, thirty or forty of Burr&rsquo;s 
			followers under the leadership of Blennerhassett left the island in four 
			or five flatboats for New Orleans, on the night of the 10th of December, 
			and a few days later were joined by Burr himself at the mouth of the 
			Cumberland. When the little expedition paused near Natchez, on the 10th of 
			January, Burr was confronted with a newspaper containing a transcription 
			of his fatal letter to Wilkinson. A week later, learning that his former 
			ally, Wilkinson, had now established a reign of terror at New Orleans 
			directed against his followers, and feeling no desire to test the tender 
			mercies of a court-martial presided over by his former associate, Burr 
			surrendered himself into the custody of the acting Governor of 
			Mississippi Territory. But the refusal of the territorial grand jury to 
			indict him suggested the hope that he might 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
			still escape from the reach of the law. He therefore
      plunged into the wilderness, headed for the Spanish border, and had all
      but reached his destination when he was recognized and recaptured at
      Wakefield, Alabama.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the peculiar and complicated circumstances which led up to it,
      Burr&rsquo;s case was from the outset imbued with factional and partisan
      politics of the most extreme kind. While the conspiracy was at its height,
      Jefferson, though emphatically warned, had refused to lend it any credence
      whatever; but when the danger was well over he had thrown the whole
      country into a panic, and had even asked Congress to suspend the writ of
      habeas corpus. The Federalists and the President&rsquo;s enemies within 
			his own party, headed by the redoubtable Randolph, were instantly alert 
			to the opportunity which Jefferson&rsquo;s inexplicable conduct afforded 
			them. &ldquo;The mountain had labored and brought forth a mouse,&rdquo; 
			quoted the supercilious; the executive dragnet had descended to envelop 
			the monster which was ready to split the Union or at least to embroil its 
			relations with a friendly power, and had brought up&mdash;a few peaceful 
			agriculturists! Nor was this the worst of the matter, contended these 
			critics of the Administration, for 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
			the real source of the peril had been the President&rsquo;s
      own action in assigning the command at New Orleans to Wilkinson, a
      pensioner of Spain, a villain &ldquo;from the bark to the very 
			core.&rdquo; Yet so far was the President from admitting this error that 
			he now attributed the salvation of the country to &ldquo;the 
			soldier&rsquo;s honor&rdquo; and &ldquo;the citizen&rsquo;s
      fidelity&rdquo; of this same Wilkinson. Surely, then, the real defendants 
			before the bar of opinion were Thomas Jefferson and his precious ally 
			James Wilkinson, not their harried and unfortunate victim, Aaron Burr!
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings against Burr occupied altogether some seven months, during
      which the sleepy little town of Richmond became the cynosure of all eyes.
      So famous was the case that it brought thither of necessity or out of
      curiosity men of every rank and grade of life, of every species of renown.
      The prosecution was in charge of the United States District Attorney,
      George Hay&mdash;serious, humorless, faithful to Jefferson&rsquo;s 
			interests, and absolutely devoid of the personal authority demanded by so 
			grave a cause. He was assisted by William Wirt, already a brilliant lawyer 
			and possessed of a dazzling elocution, but sadly lacking in the majesty of
      years. At the head and forefront of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
			defense stood Burr himself, an unerring legal tactician, deciding every 
			move of the great game, the stake of which for him was life itself. About 
			him were gathered the ablest members of the Richmond bar: John Wickham, 
			witty and ingenious, Edmund Randolph, ponderous and pontifical, Benjamin 
			Botts, learned and sarcastic, while from Baltimore came Luther Martin to 
			aid his &ldquo;highly respected friend,&rdquo; to keep the political pot 
			boiling, and eventually to fall desperately in love with Burr&rsquo;s 
			daughter, the beautiful Theodosia. Among the 140 witnesses there were also 
			some notable figures: William Eaton, the hero of Derne, whom Burr&rsquo;s 
			codefendant, Blennerhassett, describes for us as &ldquo;strutting about 
			the streets under a tremendous hat, with a Turkish sash over colored 
			clothes,&rdquo; and offering up, with his frequent libations in the 
			taverns, &ldquo;the copious effusions of his sorrows&rdquo;; Commodore 
			Truxton, the gallant commander of the <i>Constellation</i>; General 
			Andrew Jackson, future President of the United States, but now a vehement 
			declaimer of Burr&rsquo;s innocence&mdash;out of abundant caution for his 
			own reputation, it may be surmised; Erick Bollmann, once a participant in 
			the effort to release Lafayette from Olmutz and himself just now released 
			from 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
			durance vile on a writ of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court; 
			Samuel Swartwout, another tool of Burr&rsquo;s, reserved by the same 
			beneficent writ for a career of political roguery which was to culminate 
			in his swindling the Government out of a million and a quarter dollars; 
			and finally the bibulous and traitorous Wilkinson, &ldquo;whose 
			head&rdquo; as he himself owned, &ldquo;might err,&rdquo; but
      &ldquo;whose heart could not deceive.&rdquo; Traveling by packet from 
			New Orleans, this essential witness was heralded by the impatient 
			prosecution, till at last he burst upon the stage with all the 
			&eacute;clat of the hero in a melodrama&mdash;only to retire baffled and 
			perplexed, his villainy guessed by his own partisans.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Constitution treason against the United States consists &ldquo;only 
			in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them 
			aid and comfort,&rdquo; and no person may be convicted of it &ldquo;unless 
			on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession 
			in open court.&rdquo; The motion to commit Burr for treason thus raised at 
			the outset the question whether in this case an &ldquo;overt act&rdquo; 
			existed. Marshall, who held that no evidence had been shown to this 
			effect, denied the motion, but consented to commit the prisoner on the 
			lesser charge that he had attempted a 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
			military expedition against Spain. As this was a bailable
      offense, however, Burr was soon at liberty once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this the only respect in which the preliminary proceedings sounded
      a note of antagonism between the Chief Justice and the Administration
      which was to recur again and yet again in the months following. Only a few
      weeks earlier at Washington, Marshall had, though with some apparent
      reluctance, ordered the release of Bollmann and Swartwout, two of 
			Burr&rsquo;s tools, from the custody of the Federal authorities. Alluding 
			in his present opinion to his reason for his earlier action, he wrote: 
			&ldquo;More than five weeks have elapsed since the opinion of the Supreme 
			Court has declared the necessity of proving the fact, if it exists. Why is 
			it not proved? To the executive government is entrusted the important 
			power of prosecuting those whose crimes may disturb the public repose or 
			endanger its safety. It would be easy, in much less time than has 
			intervened since Colonel Burr has been alleged to have assembled his 
			troops, to procure affidavits establishing the fact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This sharp criticism brought an equally sharp retort from Jefferson, to
      which was added a threat. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
			In a private letter of the 20th of April, the President said: &ldquo;In 
			what terms of decency can we speak of this? As if an express could go to 
			Natchez or the mouth of the Cumberland and return in five weeks, to do 
			which has never taken less than twelve!&hellip; But all the principles 
			of law are to be perverted which would bear on the favorite offenders who 
			endeavor to overturn this odious republic!&hellip; All this, however, 
			will work well. The nation will judge both the offender and judges for 
			themselves.&hellip; They will see then and amend the error in our
      Constitution which makes any branch independent of the nation.&hellip; If 
			their [the judges] protection of Burr produces this amendment, it will do 
			more good than his condemnation would have done.&rdquo; Already the case 
			had taken on the color of a fresh contest between the President and the 
			Chief Justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 22d of May the United States Court for the Fifth Circuit and the
      Virginia District formally convened, with Marshall presiding and Judge
      Griffin at his side. On the same day the grand jury was sworn, with John
      Randolph as foreman, and presently began taking testimony. Unluckily for
      the prosecution, the proceedings now awaited the arrival of Wilkinson and
      the delay was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
			turned to skillful use by the defense to embroil further the
      relations between the Chief Justice and the President. With this end in
      view, Burr moved on the 9th of June that a <i>subp&oelig;na duces 
			tecum</i> issue to Jefferson requiring him to produce certain papers, 
			including the famous cipher letter to Wilkinson. The main question 
			involved, of course, was that of the right of the Court under any 
			circumstances to issue a subp&oelig;na to the President, but the abstract 
			issue soon became involved with a much more irritating personal one. 
			&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Luther Martin, who now found himself in his 
			element, &ldquo;this is a peculiar case, sir. The President has undertaken 
			to prejudge my client by declaring that &lsquo;of his guilt there is no 
			doubt.&rsquo; He has assumed to himself the knowledge of the Supreme Being
      himself and pretended to search the heart of my highly respected friend.
      He has proclaimed him a traitor in the face of the country which has
      rewarded him. He has let slip the dogs of war, the hell-hounds of
      persecution, to hunt down my friend. And would this President of the
      United States, who has raised all this absurd clamor, pretend to keep back
      the papers which are wanted for this trial, where life itself is at
      stake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wirt&rsquo;s answer to Martin was also a rebuke 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
			to the Court. &ldquo;Do they [the defense] flatter themselves,&rdquo; 
			he asked, &ldquo;that this court feel political prejudices which will 
			supply the place of argument and innocence on the part of the prisoner? 
			Their conduct amounts to an insinuation of the sort. But I do not 
			believe it.&hellip; Sir, no man, foreigner or citizen, who hears
      this language addressed to the court, and received with all the
      complacency at least which silence can imply, can make any inference from
      it very honorable to the court.&rdquo; These words touched 
			Marshall&rsquo;s conscience, as well they might. At the close of the day 
			he asked counsel henceforth to &ldquo;confine themselves to the point 
			really before the court&rdquo;&mdash;a request which, however, was by no 
			means invariably observed through the following days.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two later Marshall ruled that the subp&oelig;na should issue, 
			holding that neither the personal nor the official character of the 
			President exempted him from the operation of that constitutional clause 
			which guarantees accused persons &ldquo;compulsory process for obtaining 
			witnesses&rdquo; in their behalf. The demand made upon the President, 
			said the Chief Justice, by his official duties is not an unremitting one, 
			and, &ldquo;if it should exist at the time when his attendance on a court 
			is 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
			required, it would be sworn on the return of the subp&oelig;na and would 
			rather constitute a reason for not obeying the process of the court than 
			a reason against its being issued.&rdquo; Jefferson, however, neither 
			obeyed the writ nor swore anything on its return, though he forwarded 
			some of the papers required to Hay, the district attorney, to be used as 
			the latter might deem best. The President&rsquo;s argument was grounded 
			on the mutual independence of the three departments of Government; and he 
			asked whether the independence of the Executive could long survive 
			&ldquo;if the smaller courts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep 
			him constantly trudging from North to South and East to West, and 
			withdraw him entirely from his executive duties?&rdquo; The
      President had the best of the encounter on all scores. Not only had
      Marshall forgotten for the nonce the doctrine he himself had stated in
      Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison regarding the constitutional discretion of the
      Executive, but what was worse still, he had forgotten his own discretion
      on that occasion. He had fully earned his rebuff, but that fact did not
      appreciably sweeten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 24th of June the grand jury reported two indictments against Burr,
      one for treason and the other for misdemeanor. The former charged that
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
      Burr, moved thereto &ldquo;by the instigation of the devil,&rdquo; had on 
			the 10th of December previous levied war against the United States at 
			Blennerhassett&rsquo;s island, in the county of Wood, of the District of 
			Virginia, and had on the day following, at the same place, set in motion a 
			warlike array against the city of New Orleans. The latter charged that a 
			further purpose of this same warlike array was an invasion of Mexico. 
			Treason not being a bailable offense, Burr had now to go to jail, but, as 
			the city jail was alleged to be unhealthful, the Court allowed him to be 
			removed to quarters which had been proffered by the Governor of the State 
			in the penitentiary just outside the city. Burr&rsquo;s situation here, 
			writes his biographer, &ldquo;was extremely agreeable. He had a suite of 
			rooms in the third story, extending one hundred feet, where he was allowed 
			to see his friends without the presence of a witness. His rooms were so 
			thronged with visitors at times as to present the appearance of a levee. 
			Servants were continually arriving with messages, notes, and inquiries, 
			bringing oranges, lemons, pineapples, raspberries, apricots, cream, 
			butter, ice, and other articles&mdash;presents from the ladies of the 
			city. In expectation of his daughter&rsquo;s arrival, some of his friends 
			in town provided 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
			a house for her accommodation. The jailer, too, was all 
			civility.&rdquo; &sup1; Little wonder that such goings-on are
      said to have &ldquo;filled the measure of Jefferson&rsquo;s 
			disgust.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The trial itself opened on Monday, the 3d of August. The first business in
      hand was to get a jury which would answer to the constitutional
      requirement of impartiality&mdash;a task which it was soon discovered was
      likely to prove a difficult one. The original panel of forty-eight men
      contained only four who had not expressed opinions unfavorable to the
      prisoner, and of these four all but one admitted some degree of prejudice
      against him. These four were nevertheless accepted as jurors. A second
      panel was then summoned which was even more unpromising in its make-up,
      and Burr&rsquo;s counsel began hinting that the trial would have to be 
			quashed, when Burr himself arose and offered to select eight out of the  
			whole <i>venire</i> to add to the four previously chosen. The offer was 
			accepted, and notwithstanding that several of the jurors thus obtained had 
			publicly declared opinions hostile to the accused, the jury was sworn in 
			on the 17th of August.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
      At first glance Burr&rsquo;s concession in the selecting of a jury seems
      extraordinary. But then, why should one so confident of being able to
      demonstrate his innocence fear prejudice which rested on no firmer basis
      than ignorance of the facts? This reflection, however, probably played
      small part in Burr&rsquo;s calculations, for already he knew that if the
      contemplated strategy of his counsel prevailed the case would never come
      before the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first witness called by the prosecution was Eaton, who was prepared to
      recount the substance of numerous conversations he had held with Burr in
      Washington in the winter of 1805-6, in which Burr had gradually unveiled
      to him the treasonable character of his project. No sooner, however, was
      Eaton sworn than the defense entered the objection that his testimony was
      not yet relevant, contending that in a prosecution for treason the great
      material fact on which the merits of the entire controversy pivots was the
      overt act, which must be &ldquo;<em>an open act of war</em>&rdquo;; just 
			as in a murder trial the fact of the killing, the <i>corpus delicti</i>, 
			must be proved before any other testimony was relevant, so in the pending 
			prosecution, said they, no testimony was admissible until the overt act
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
			had been shown in the manner required by the Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of answering this argument fell to Wirt, who argued, and
      apparently with justice, that the prosecution was free to introduce its
      evidence in any order it saw fit, provided only that the evidence was
      relevant to the issue raised by the indictment, and that if an overt act
      was proved &ldquo;in the course of the whole evidence,&rdquo; that would 
			be sufficient. The day following the Court read an opinion which is a 
			model of ambiguous and equivocal statement, but the purport was fairly 
			clear: for the moment the Court would not interfere, and the prosecution 
			was free to proceed as it thought best, with the warning that the 
			Damocles sword of &ldquo;irrelevancy&rdquo; was suspended over its head 
			by the barest thread and might
      fall at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next two days the legal battle was kept in abeyance while the
      taking of testimony went forward. Eaton was followed on the stand by
      Commodore Truxton, who stated that in conversation with him Burr had
      seemed to be aiming only at an expedition against Mexico. Then came
      General Morgan and his two sons, who asserted their belief in the
      treasonable character of Burr&rsquo;s designs. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
			Finally a series of 
			witnesses, the majority of them servants of Blennerhassett, testified 
			that on the evening of December 10, 1806, Burr&rsquo;s forces had 
			assembled on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      This line of testimony concluded, the prosecution next indicated its
      intention of introducing evidence to show Burr&rsquo;s connection with the
      assemblage on the island, when the defense sprang the <i>coup</i> it had 
			been maturing from the outset. Pointing out the notorious fact that on the
      night of the 10th of December Burr had not been present at the island but
      had been two hundred miles away in Kentucky, they contended that, under
      the Constitution, the assemblage on Blennerhassett&rsquo;s island could 
			not be regarded as his act, even granting that he had advised it, for, 
			said they, advising war is one thing but levying it is quite another. If 
			this interpretation was correct, then no overt act of levying war, either
      within the jurisdiction of the Court or stated in the indictment, had
      been, or could be, shown against Burr. Hence the taking of 
			evidence&mdash;if not the cause itself, indeed&mdash;should be 
			discontinued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legal question raised by this argument was the comparatively simple
      one whether the constitutional provision regarding treason was to be
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
      interpreted in the light of the Common Law doctrine that &ldquo;in treason 
			all are principals.&rdquo; For if it were to be so interpreted and if 
			Burr&rsquo;s connection with the general conspiracy culminating in the 
			assemblage was demonstrable by any sort of legal evidence, then the 
			assemblage was his act, his overt act, proved moreover by thrice the two 
			witnesses constitutionally required! Again it fell to Wirt to represent 
			the prosecution, and he discharged his task most brilliantly. He showed 
			beyond peradventure that the Common Law doctrine was grounded upon 
			unshakable authority; that, considering the fact that the entire 
			phraseology of the constitutional clause regarding treason comes from an 
			English statute of Edward III&rsquo;s time, it was reasonable, if not 
			indispensable, to construe it in the light of the Common Law; and that, 
			certainly as to a procurer of treason, such as Burr was charged with 
			being, the Common Law doctrine was the only just doctrine, being merely a 
			reaffirmation of the even more ancient principle that &ldquo;what one 
			does through another, he does himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In elaboration of this last point Wirt launched forth upon that famous
      passage in which he contrasted Burr and the pathetic victim of his
      conspiracy:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
      Who [he asked] is Blennerhassett? A native of Ireland, a man of letters,
      who fled from the storms of his own country to find quiet in ours.&hellip;
      Possessing himself of a beautiful island in the Ohio he rears upon it a
      palace and decorates it with every romantic embellishment of fancy. [Then]
      in the midst of all this peace, this innocent simplicity, this pure
      banquet of the heart, the destroyer comes &hellip; to change this paradise 
			into a hell.&hellip; By degrees he infuses [into the heart of 
			Blennerhassett] the poison of his own ambition.&hellip; In a short time 
			the whole man is changed, and every object of his former delight is 
			relinquished.&hellip; His books are abandoned.&hellip; His enchanted 
			island is destined soon to relapse into a wilderness; and in a few months 
			we find the beautiful and tender partner of his bosom, whom he lately 
			&lsquo;permitted not the winds of summer to visit too roughly,&rsquo; 
			we find her shivering at midnight on the winter banks of the Ohio and 
			mingling her tears with the torrents that froze as they fell. Yet this 
			unfortunate man, thus ruined, and undone and made to play a subordinate 
			part in this grand drama of guilt and treason, this man is to be called 
			the principal offender, while he by whom he was thus plunged in misery is 
			comparatively innocent, a mere accessory! Is this reason? Is it law? Is it 
			humanity? Sir, neither the human heart nor the human understanding will 
			bear a perversion so monstrous and absurd!
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      But there was one human heart, one human understanding&mdash;and that, in
      ordinary circumstances, a very good one&mdash;which was quite willing to
      shoulder just such a monstrous perversion, or 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
			at least its equivalent, and that heart was John Marshall&rsquo;s. The 
			discussion of the motion to arrest the evidence continued ten days, most 
			of the time being occupied by Burr&rsquo;s attorneys. &sup1; Finally, 
			on the last day of the month, the Chief Justice
      handed down an opinion accepting practically the whole contention of
      Burr&rsquo;s attorneys, but offering a totally new set of reasons for it. 
			On the main question at issue, namely, whether under the Constitution all
      involved in a treasonable enterprise are principals, Marshall pretended
      not to pass; but in fact he rejected the essential feature of the Common
      Law doctrine, namely, the necessary legal presence at the scene of action
      of all parties to the conspiracy. The crux of his argument he embodied in
      the following statement: &ldquo;If in one case the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
			presence of the individual make the guilt of the [treasonable] assemblage 
			<em>his</em> guilt, and in the other case, the procurement by the 
			individual make the guilt of the [treasonable] assemblage, his guilt, then 
			presence and procurement are equally component parts of the overt act, and 
			equally require two witnesses.&rdquo; Unfortunately for this argument, the 
			Constitution does not require that the &ldquo;component parts&rdquo; of 
			the overt act be proved by two witnesses, but only that the overt 
			act&mdash;the <i>corpus delicti</i>&mdash;be so proved; and for the simple 
			reason that, when by further evidence any particular individual is 
			connected with the treasonable combination which brought about the overt 
			act, that act, assuming the Common Law doctrine, becomes his act, and he 
			is accordingly responsible for it at the place where it occurred. 
			Burr&rsquo;s attorneys admitted this contention unreservedly. Indeed, 
			that was precisely the reason why they had opposed the Common Law
      doctrine.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_107-1" name="footer_107-1"></a>
				&sup1; A recurrent feature of their arguments was a denunciation of
				&ldquo;constructive treason.&rdquo; But this was mere declamation. 
				Nobody was charging Burr with any sort of treason except that which 
				is specifically defined by the Constitution itself, namely, the 
				levying of war against the United States. The only question at 
				issue was as to the method of proof by which this crime may be 
				validly established in the case of one accused of procuring treason. 
				There was also much talk about the danger and injustice of dragging 
				a man from one end of the country to stand trial for an act 
				committed at the other end of it. The answer was that, if the man 
				himself procured the act or joined others in bringing it about, he 
				ought to stand trial where the act occurred. This same
				&ldquo;injustice&rdquo; may happen today in the case of murder!
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s effort to steer between this doctrine and its obvious
      consequences for the case before him placed him, therefore, in the curious
      position of demanding that two overt acts be proved each by two witnesses.
      But if two, why not twenty? For it must often happen that the 
			traitor&rsquo;s connection 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
			with the overt act is demonstrable not by a single act but a
      series of acts. Furthermore, in the case of procurers of treason, this
      connection will ordinarily not appear in overt acts at all but, as in
      Burr&rsquo;s own case, will be covert. Can it be, then, that the 
			Constitution is chargeable with the absurdity of regarding the procurers 
			of treason as traitors and yet of making their conviction impossible? The 
			fact of the matter was that six months earlier, before his attitude toward 
			Burr&rsquo;s doings had begun to take color from his hatred and distrust 
			of Jefferson, Marshall had entertained no doubt that the Common Law 
			doctrine underlay the constitutional definition of treason. Speaking for 
			the Supreme Court in the case of Bollmann and Swartwout, he had said: 
			&ldquo;It is not the intention of the Court to say that no individual can 
			be guilty of this crime who has not appeared in arms against his country; 
			on the contrary, if war be actually levied, that is, if a body of men be 
			actually assembled for the purpose of effecting by force a treasonable 
			purpose, all those who perform any part however minute, or however remote 
			from the scene of action, and who are actually leagued in the general 
			conspiracy, are to be considered traitors.&rdquo; Marshall&rsquo;s effort 
			to square this previous opinion
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
			with his later position was as unconvincing as it was labored. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_109-1" name="footer_109-1"></a>
				&sup1; The way in which Marshall proceeded to do this was to treat the
        phrase &ldquo;perform a part&rdquo; as demanding &ldquo;a levying of 
				war&rdquo; on the part of the performer. (Robertson, <i>Reports,</i> 
				vol. II, p. 438.) But this explanation will not hold water. For what 
				then becomes of the phrase &ldquo;scene of action&rdquo; in the passage 
				just quoted? What is the difference between the part to be performed 
				&ldquo;however minute,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;action&rdquo; from
				which the performer may be &ldquo;however remote&rdquo;? It is perfectly 
				evident that the &ldquo;action&rdquo; referred to is the assemblage 
				which is regarded as the overt act of war, and that the &ldquo;part 
				however minute&rdquo; is something very different.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      Burr&rsquo;s attorneys were more prudent: they dismissed Marshall&rsquo;s 
			earlier words outright as <i>obiter dicta</i>&mdash;and erroneous at that! 
			Nevertheless when, thirty years later, Story, Marshall&rsquo;s friend and 
			pupil, was in search of the best judicial definition of treason within the 
			meaning of the Constitution, he selected this sentence from the case of 
			Bollmann and Swartwout and passed by the elaborate opinion in Burr&rsquo;s 
			case in significant silence. But reputation is a great magician in 
			transmuting heresy into accepted teaching. Posthumously Marshall&rsquo;s 
			opinion has attained a rank and authority with the legal profession that 
			it never enjoyed in his own time. Regarding it, therefore, as today 
			established doctrine, we may say that it has quite reversed the relative 
			importance of conspiracy and overt act where the treason is by levying 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
			war. At the Common Law, and in the view of the framers of the 
			Constitution, the importance of the overt act of war was to make the 
			conspiracy visible, to put its existence beyond surmise. By 
			Marshall&rsquo;s view each traitor is chargeable only with his own overt 
			acts, and the conspiracy is of importance merely as showing the intention 
			of such acts. And from this it results logically, as Marshall saw, though 
			he did not venture to say so explicitly, that the procurer of treason is 
			not a traitor unless he has also participated personally in an overt act 
			of war. As Wirt very justifiably contended, such a result is 
			&ldquo;monstrous,&rdquo; and, what is more, it has not been possible to 
			adhere to it in practice. In recent legislation necessitated by the Great 
			War, Congress has restored the old Common Law view of treason but has 
			avoided the constitutional difficulty by labeling the offense 
			&ldquo;Espionage.&rdquo; Indeed, the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917,
      scraps Marshall&rsquo;s opinion pretty completely. &sup1;

				&sup1; See especially Title I, Section 4, of the Act. For evidence of
				the modern standing of Marshall&rsquo;s opinion, see the chorus of 
				approval sounded by the legal fraternity in Dillon&rsquo;s three 
				volumes. In support of the Common Law doctrine, see the authorities 
				cited in 27 <i>Yale Law Journal</i>, p. 342 and footnotes; the chapter

				and Druecker <i>vs.</i> Salomon, 21 Wis., 621.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      On the day following the reading of Marshall&rsquo;s 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
			opinion, the prosecution, unable to produce two witnesses who had 
			actually <i>seen</i> Burr procure the assemblage on the island, abandoned 
			the case to the jury. Shortly thereafter the following verdict was 
			returned: &ldquo;We of the jury say that Aaron Burr is not proved to be 
			guilty under this indictment by any evidence submitted to us. We 
			therefore find him not guilty.&rdquo; At the order of the Chief Justice 
			this Scotch verdict was entered on the records of the
      court as a simple Not Guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s conduct of Burr&rsquo;s trial for treason is the one 
			serious blemish in his judicial record, but for all that it was not 
			without a measure of extenuation. The President, too, had behaved 
			deplorably and, feeling himself on the defensive, had pressed matters 
			with most unseemly zeal, so that the charge of political persecution 
			raised by Burr&rsquo;s attorneys was, to say the least, not groundless. 
			Furthermore, in opposing the President in this matter, Marshall had shown 
			his usual political sagacity. Had Burr been convicted, the advantage must 
			all have gone to the Administration. The only possible credit the Chief 
			Justice could extract from the case would be from assuming that lofty 
			tone of calm, unmoved impartiality of which Marshall was such a 
			master&mdash;and never more than on 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
			this occasion&mdash;and from setting himself sternly against popular 
			hysteria. The words with which his opinion closes have been often quoted:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Much has been said in the course of the argument on points on which the
      Court feels no inclination to comment particularly, but which may, perhaps
      not improperly receive some notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this Court dare not usurp power is most true.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this Court dare not shrink from its duty is not less true.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man is desirous of placing himself in a disagreeable situation. No man
      is desirous of becoming the popular subject of calumny. No man, might he
      let the bitter cup pass from him without self-reproach, would drain it to
      the bottom. But if he have no choice in the case, if there be no
      alternative presented to him but a dereliction of duty or the opprobrium
      of those who are denominated the world, he merits the contempt as well as
      the indignation of his country who can hesitate which to embrace.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      One could not require a better illustration of that faculty of 
			&ldquo;apparently deep self-conviction&rdquo; which Wirt had noted in 
			the Chief Justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it must be owned that Burr&rsquo;s case offered Marshall a 
			tempting opportunity to try out the devotion of Republicans to that 
			ideal of judicial deportment which had led them so vehemently to criticize 
			Justice Chase and to charge him with 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
			being &ldquo;oppressive,&rdquo; with 
			refusing to give counsel for defense an opportunity to be heard, with 
			transgressing the state law of procedure, with showing too great liking 
			for Common Law ideas of sedition, with setting up the President as a sort 
			of monarch beyond the reach of judicial process. Marshall&rsquo;s conduct 
			of Burr&rsquo;s trial now exactly reversed every one of these grounds of 
			complaint. Whether he intended it or not, it was a neat turning of the 
			tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jefferson, who was at once both the most theoretical and the least
      logical of men, was of course hardly prepared to see matters in that
      light. As soon as the news reached him of Burr&rsquo;s acquittal, he 
			ordered Hay to press the indictment for misdemeanor&mdash;not for the 
			purpose of convicting Burr, but of getting the evidence down in a form in 
			which it should be available for impeachment proceedings against Marshall. 
			For some weeks longer, therefore, the Chief Justice sat listening to 
			evidence which was to be used against himself. But the impeachment never 
			came, for a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest 
			link in the combination against the Chief Justice was a very fragile one 
			indeed&mdash;the iniquitous Wilkinson. Even the faithful and melancholy 
			Hay 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
			finally abandoned him. &ldquo;The declaration which I made in court in 
			his favor some time ago,&rdquo; he wrote the President, &ldquo;was 
			precipitate.&hellip; My confidence in him is destroyed.&hellip; I am 
			sorry for it, on his account, on the public account, and because you have 
			expressed opinions in his favor.&rdquo; It was obviously impossible to 
			impeach the Chief Justice for having prevented the hanging of Aaron Burr 
			on the testimony of such a miscreant.
    </p>
		<hr class="break">
    <p>
      Though the years immediately following the Burr trial were not a time of
      conspicuous activity for Marshall, they paved the way in more than one
      direction for his later achievement. Jefferson&rsquo;s retirement from the
      Presidency at last relieved the Chief Justice from the warping influence
      of a hateful personal contest and from anxiety for his official security.
      Jefferson&rsquo;s successors were men more willing to identify the cause 
			of the Federal Judiciary with that of national unity. Better still, the 
			War of 1812 brought about the demise of the Federalist party and thus 
			cleared the Court of every suspicion of partisan bias. Henceforth the 
			great political issue was the general one of the nature of the Union and 
			the Constitution, a field in which Marshall&rsquo;s talent for debate made 
			him master. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
			In the meantime the Court was acquiring that personnel which 
			it was to retain almost intact for nearly twenty years; and, although the 
			new recruits came from the ranks of his former party foes, Marshall had 
			little trouble in bringing their views into general conformity with his 
			own constitutional creed. Nor was his triumph an exclusively personal one. 
			He was aided in very large measure by the fact that the war had brought 
			particularism temporarily into discredit in all sections of the country. 
			Of Marshall&rsquo;s associates in 1812, Justice Washington alone had come 
			to the bench earlier, yet he was content to speak through the mouth of 
			his illustrious colleague, save on the notable occasion when he led the 
			only revolt of a majority of the Court from the Chief Justice&rsquo;s 
			leadership in the field of Constitutional Law. &sup1; Johnson of South 
			Carolina, a man of no little personal vanity, affected a greater 
			independence, for which he was on one occasion warmly congratulated by 
			Jefferson; yet even his separate opinions, though they sometimes challenge 
			Marshall&rsquo;s more sweeping premises and bolder method of reasoning, 
			are after all mostly concurring ones. Marshall&rsquo;s really invaluable 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
			aid among his associates was Joseph Story, who in 1811, at the age of 
			thirty-two, was appointed by Madison in succession to Cushing. Still 
			immature, enthusiastically willing to learn, warmly affectionate, and with 
			his views on constitutional issues as yet unformed, Story fell at once 
			under the spell of Marshall&rsquo;s equally gentle but vastly more 
			resolute personality; and the result was one of the most fruitful 
			friendships of our history. Marshall&rsquo;s &ldquo;original bias,&rdquo; 
			to quote Story&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;as well as the choice of his 
			mind, was to general principles and comprehensive views, rather than to 
			technical or recondite learning.&rdquo; Story&rsquo;s own bias, which was 
			supported by his prodigious industry, was just the reverse. The two men 
			thus supplemented each other admirably. A tradition of some venerability 
			represents Story as having said that Marshall was wont to remark: 
			&ldquo;Now Story, that is the law; you find the precedents for it.&rdquo; 
			Whether true or not, the tale at least illustrates the truth. Marshall 
			owed to counsel a somewhat similar debt in the way of leading up to his 
			decisions, for, as Story points out, &ldquo;he was solicitous to hear 
			arguments and not to decide cases without them, nor did any judge ever 
			profit more by them.&rdquo; But in the field of Constitutional Law, at 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
			least, Marshall used counsel&rsquo;s argument not so much to indicate
      what his own judicial goal ought to be as to discover the best route
      thereto&mdash;often, indeed, through the welcome stimulus which a clash of
      views gave to his reasoning powers.

      Though the wealth of available legal talent at this period was 
			impressively illustrated in connection both with Chase&rsquo;s impeachment 
			and with Burr&rsquo;s trial, yet on neither of these occasions appeared 
			William Pinkney of Maryland, the attorney to whom Marshall acknowledged 
			his greatest indebtedness, and who was universally acknowledged to be the
      leader of the American Bar from 1810 until his death twelve years later.
      Besides being a great lawyer, Pinkney was also a notable personality, as
      George Ticknor&rsquo;s sketch of him as he appeared before the Supreme 
			Court in 1815 goes to prove:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      You must imagine, if you can, a man formed on nature&rsquo;s most liberal
      scale, who at the age of 50 is possessed with the ambition of being a
      pretty fellow, wears corsets to diminish his bulk, uses cosmetics, as he
      told Mrs. Gore, to smooth and soften a skin growing somewhat wrinkled and
      rigid with age, dresses in a style which would be thought foppish in a
      much younger man. You must imagine such a man standing before the gravest
      tribunal in the land, and engaged in causes of the deepest moment; 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
			but
      still apparently thinking how he can declaim like a practised rhetorician
      in the London Cockpit, which he used to frequent. Yet you must, at the
      same time, imagine his declamation to be chaste and precise in its
      language and cogent, logical and learned in its argument, free from the
      artifice and affectation of his manner, and in short, opposite to what you
      might fairly have expected from his first appearance and tones. And when
      you have compounded these inconsistencies in your imagination, and united
      qualities which on common occasions nature seems to hold asunder, you
      will, perhaps, begin to form some idea of what Mr. Pinkney is.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Such was the man whom Marshall, Story, and Taney all considered the
      greatest lawyer who had ever appeared before the Supreme Court.

    <p>
      At the close of the War of 1812, Marshall, though he had decided many
      important questions of International Law, &sup1; nevertheless found 
			himself only at the threshold of his real fame. Yet even thus early he had
      indicated his point of view. Thus in the case of the United States 
			<i>vs.</i> Peters, &sup2; which was decided in 1809, the question before 
			the Court was whether a mandamus should issue to the United States 
			District Judge of Pennsylvania ordering him to enforce, in the face of the 
			opposition of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
			the state Government, a decision handed down in a prize case more than 
			thirty years before by the old Committee of Appeals of the Continental 
			Congress. Marshall answered the question affirmatively, saying: 
			&ldquo;If the legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the 
			judgments of the courts of the United States and destroy the rights 
			acquired under those judgments, the Constitution itself becomes a solemn 
			mockery, and the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by 
			the instrumentality of its own tribunals.&rdquo;

      Marshall&rsquo;s decision evoked a warm protest from the Pennsylvania
      Legislature and led to a proposal of amendment to the Constitution
      providing &ldquo;an impartial tribunal&rdquo; between the General 
			Government and the States; and these expressions of dissent in turn 
			brought the Virginia Assembly to the defense of the Supreme Court.
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      The commission to whom was referred the communication of the governor of
      Pennsylvania [reads the Virginia document] &hellip; are of the opinion 
			that a tribunal is already provided by the Constitution of the United 
			States, <i>to wit</i>; the Supreme Court, more eminently qualified from 
			their habits and duties, from the mode of their selection, and from the 
			tenure of their offices, to decide the disputes aforesaid in an 
			enlightened and impartial manner than any other tribunal which could be 
			created.

      The members of the Supreme Court are selected from those in the United
      States who are most celebrated for virtue and legal learning.&hellip; The
      duties they have to perform lead them necessarily to the most enlarged and
      accurate acquaintance with the jurisdiction of the federal and several
      State courts together, and with the admirable symmetry of our government.
      The tenure of their offices enables them to pronounce the sound and
      correct opinions they have formed, without fear, favor or partiality.

    <p>
      Was it coincidence or something more that during Marshall&rsquo;s 
			incumbency Virginia paid her one and only tribute to the impartiality of 
			the Supreme Court while Burr&rsquo;s acquittal was still vivid in the 
			minds of all? Or was it due to the fact that &ldquo;the Great Lama of 
			the Little Mountain&rdquo;&mdash;to use Marshall&rsquo;s disrespectful 
			appellation for Jefferson&mdash;had not yet converted the Virginia 
			Court of Appeals into the angry oracle of his own unrelenting hatred of 
			the Chief Justice? Whatever the reason, within five years 
			Virginia&rsquo;s attitude had again shifted, and she had become once more
      what she had been in 1798-99, the rallying point of the forces of
      Confederation and State Rights.

    <p class="noindent">
      &ldquo;<span class="smcap">John Marshall</span> stands in history as 
			one of that small group of men who have founded States. He was a 
			nation-maker, a state-builder. His monument is in the history of the 
			United States and his name is written upon the Constitution of his 
			country.&rdquo; So spoke Senator Lodge, on John Marshall Day, February 4, 
			1901. &ldquo;I should feel a &hellip; doubt,&rdquo; declared Justice 
			Holmes on the same occasion, &ldquo;whether, after Hamilton and the 
			Constitution itself, Marshall&rsquo;s work proved more than a strong 
			intellect, a good style, personal ascendancy in his court, courage, 
			justice, and the convictions of his party.&rdquo; Both these divergent 
			estimates of the great Chief Justice have their value. It is well to be 
			reminded that Marshall&rsquo;s task lay within the four corners of the 
			Constitution, whose purposes he did not originate, especially since no 
			one would have been quicker than himself to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
			disown praise implying anything different. 
      None the less it was no ordinary skill and courage which, assisted by 
			great office, gave enduring definition to the purposes of the Constitution 
			at the very time when the whole trend of public opinion was setting in 
			most strongly against them. It must not be forgotten that Hamilton, whose 
			name Justice Holmes invokes in his somewhat too grudging encomium of 
			Marshall, had pronounced the Constitution &ldquo;a frail and worthless 
			fabric.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s own outlook upon his task sprang in great part from a 
			profound conviction of calling. He was thoroughly persuaded that he knew 
			the intentions of the framers of the Constitution&mdash;the intentions 
			which had been wrought into the instrument itself&mdash;and he was equally
      determined that these intentions should prevail. For this reason he
      refused to regard his office merely as a judicial tribunal; it was a
      platform from which to promulgate sound constitutional principles, the
      very cathedra indeed of constitutional orthodoxy. Not one of the cases
      which elicited his great opinions but might easily have been decided on
      comparatively narrow grounds in precisely the same way in which he decided
      it on broad, general principles, but with the probable result that it
      would never 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
			again have been heard of outside the law courts. To take a
      timid or obscure way to a merely tentative goal would have been at
      variance equally with Marshall&rsquo;s belief in his mission and with his
      instincts as a great debater. Hence he forged his weapon&mdash;the 
			<i>obiter dictum</i>&mdash;by whose broad strokes was hewn the highroad 
			of a national destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s task naturally was not performed <i>in vacuo</i>: he owed 
			much to the preconceptions of his contemporaries. His invariable quest, as 
			students of his opinions are soon aware, was for the axiomatic, for 
			absolute principles, and in this inquiry he met the intellectual demands 
			of a period whose first minds still owned the sway of the syllogism and 
			still loved what Bacon called the &ldquo;spacious liberty of 
			generalities.&rdquo; In Marshall&rsquo;s method&mdash;as in the older 
			syllogistic logic, whose phraseology begins to sound somewhat strange to 
			twentieth century ears&mdash;the essential operation consisted in 
			eliminating the &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; or &ldquo;irrelevant&rdquo; 
			elements from the &ldquo;significant&rdquo; facts of a case, and then
      recognizing that this particular case had been foreseen and provided for
      in a general rule of law. Proceeding in this way Marshall was able to
      build up a body of thought the internal consistency of which, even when it
      did not convince, yet 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
			baffled the only sort of criticism which contemporaries were disposed to 
			apply. Listen, for instance, to the despairing cry of John Randolph of 
			Roanoke: &ldquo;All wrong,&rdquo; said he of one of Marshall&rsquo;s 
			opinions, &ldquo;all wrong, but no man in the United States can tell
      why or wherein.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall found his first opportunity to elaborate the tenets of his
      nationalistic creed in the case of M&rsquo;Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, 
			which was decided at the same term with the Dartmouth College case and 
			that of Sturges <i>vs.</i> Crowinshield&mdash;the greatest six weeks in 
			the history of the Court. The question immediately involved was whether 
			the State of Maryland had the right to tax the notes issued by the branch 
			which the Bank of the United States had recently established at Baltimore. 
			But this question raised the further one whether the United States had in 
			the first place the right to charter the Bank and to authorize it to 
			establish branches within the States. The outcome turned on the 
			interpretation to be given the &ldquo;necessary and proper&rdquo; clause 
			of the Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last two questions were in 1819 by no means novel. In the 
			<i>Federalist</i> itself Hamilton had boldly asked, &ldquo;Who is to judge 
			of the necessity and propriety of the laws to be passed for executing the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
			powers of the Union?&rdquo; and had announced that &ldquo;the National 
			Government, like every other, must judge in the first instance, of 
			the proper exercise of its powers, and its constituents in the 
			last,&rdquo; a view which seems hardly to leave room even for 
			judicial control. Three years later as Secretary of the Treasury,
      Hamilton had brought forward the proposal which soon led to the chartering
      of the Bank of 1791. The measure precipitated the first great discussion
      over the interpretation of the new Constitution. Hamilton owned that
      Congress had no specifically granted power to charter a bank but contended
      that such an institution was a &ldquo;necessary and proper&rdquo; means 
			for carrying out certain of the enumerated powers of the National 
			Government such, for instance, as borrowing money and issuing a 
			currency. For, said he in effect, &ldquo;necessary and proper&rdquo; 
			signify &ldquo;convenient,&rdquo; and the clause was intended to 
			indicate that the National Government should enjoy a wide range of 
			choice in the selection of means for carrying out its enumerated
      powers. Jefferson, on the other hand, maintained that the 
			&ldquo;necessary and proper&rdquo; clause was a restrictive clause, 
			meant to safeguard the rights of the States, that a law in order to be 
			&ldquo;necessary and proper&rdquo; must be both
      &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
			<em>and</em> &ldquo;proper,&rdquo; and that both terms ought to be 
			construed narrowly. Jefferson&rsquo;s opposition, however, proved 
			unavailing, and the banking institution which was created continued till 
			1811 without its validity being once tested in the courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second Bank of the United States, whose branch Maryland was now trying
      to tax, received its charter in 1816 from President Madison. Well might
      John Quincy Adams exclaim that the &ldquo;Republicans had outfederalized 
			the Federalists!&rdquo; Yet the gibe was premature. The country at large 
			was as yet blind to the responsibilities of nationality. That vision of 
			national unity which indubitably underlies the Constitution was after all 
			the vision of an aristocracy conscious of a solidarity of interests
      transcending state lines. It is equally true that until the Civil War, at
      the earliest, the great mass of Americans still felt themselves to be
      first of all citizens of their particular States. Nor did this
      individualistic bias long remain in want of leadership capable of giving
      it articulate expression. The amount of political talent which existed
      within the State of Virginia alone in the first generation of our national
      history is amazing to contemplate, but this talent unfortunately exhibited
      one most damaging blemish. The intense individualism 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
			of the
      planter-aristocrat could not tolerate in any possible situation the idea
      of a control which he could not himself ultimately either direct or
      reject. In the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which
      regard the Constitution as a compact of sovereign States and the National
      Government merely as their agent, the particularistic outlook definitely
      received a constitutional creed which in time was to become, at least in
      the South, a gloss upon the Constitution regarded as fully as
      authoritative as the original instrument. This recognition of state
      sovereignty was, indeed, somewhat delayed by the federalization of the
      Republican party in consequence of the capture of the National Government
      by Virginia in 1800. But in 1819 the march toward dissolution and civil
      war which had begun at the summons of Jefferson was now definitely
      resumed. This was the year of the congressional struggle over the
      admission of Missouri, the most important result of which was the
      discovery by the slave owners that the greatest security of slavery lay in
      the powers of the States and that its greatest danger lay in those of the
      National Government. Henceforth the largest property interest of the
      country stood almost solidly behind State Rights.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
      It was at this critical moment that chance presented Marshall with the
      opportunity to place the opposing doctrine of nationalism on the high
      plane of judicial decision. The arguments in the Bank case, &sup1; which 
			began on February 22, 1819, and lasted nine days, brought together a
      &ldquo;constellation of lawyers&rdquo; such as had never appeared before 
			in a single case. The Bank was represented by Pinkney, Webster, and Wirt; 
			the State, by Luther Martin, Hopkinson, and Walter Jones of the District 
			of Columbia bar. In arguing for the State, Hopkinson urged the restrictive 
			view of the &ldquo;necessary and proper&rdquo; clause and sought to reduce 
			to an absurdity the doctrine of &ldquo;implied rights.&rdquo; The Bank, 
			continued Hopkinson, &ldquo;this creature of construction,&rdquo; claims 
			by further implication &ldquo;the right to enter the territory of a State 
			without its consent&rdquo; and to establish there a branch; then, by yet 
			another implication, the branch claims exemption from taxation. &ldquo;It 
			is thus with the famous fig-tree of India, whose branches shoot from the 
			trunk to a considerable distance, then drop to the earth, where they take 
			root and become trees from which also other branches shoot &hellip;, until 
			gradually a vast surface is covered, and everything perishes 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
			in the spreading shade.&rdquo; But even granting that Congress did have 
			the right to charter the Bank, still that fact would not exempt the 
			institution from taxation by any State within which it held property. 
			&ldquo;The exercise of the one sovereign power cannot be controlled by
      the exercise of the other.&rdquo;

    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      On the other side, Pinkney made the chief argument in behalf of the Bank.
      &ldquo;Mr. Pinkney,&rdquo; says Justice Story, &ldquo;rose on Monday to 
			conclude the argument; he spoke all that day and yesterday and will 
			probably conclude to-day. I never in my whole life heard a greater speech; 
			it was worth a journey from Salem to hear it; his elocution was 
			excessively vehement; but his eloquence was overwhelming. His language, 
			his style, his figures, his argument, were most brilliant and sparkling. 
			He spoke like a great statesman and patriot and a sound constitutional 
			lawyer. All the cobwebs of sophistryship and metaphysics about State 
			Rights and State Sovereignty he brushed away with a mighty besom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pinkney closed on the 3d of March, and on the 6th Marshall handed down his
      most famous opinion. He condensed Pinkney&rsquo;s three-day argument into 
			a pamphlet which may be easily read by the instructed layman in half an
      hour, for, as is 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
			invariably the case with Marshall, his condensation made for greater 
			clarity. In this opinion he also gives evidence, in their highest form, 
			of his other notable qualities as a judicial stylist: his &ldquo;tiger 
			instinct for the jugular vein&rdquo;; his rigorous pursuit of logical
      consequences; his power of stating a case, wherein he is rivaled only by
      Mansfield; his scorn of the qualifying &ldquo;but&rsquo;s,&rdquo; 
			&ldquo;if&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and &ldquo;though&rsquo;s&rdquo;; the
      pith and balance of his phrasing, a reminiscence of his early days with
      Pope; the developing momentum of his argument; above all, his audacious
      use of the <i>obiter dictum.</i> Marshall&rsquo;s later opinion in 
			Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden is, it is true, in some respects a greater 
			intellectual performance, but it does not equal this earlier opinion 
			in those qualities of form which attract the amateur and stir the 
			admiration of posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very outset of his argument in the Bank case Marshall singled out
      the question the answer to which must control all interpretation of the
      Constitution: Was the Constitution, as contended by counsel for Maryland,
      &ldquo;an act of sovereign and independent States&rdquo; whose political 
			interests must be jealously safeguarded in its construction, or, was it 
			an emanation from the American people and designed for their benefit? 
			Marshall answered
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
      that the Constitution, by its own declaration, was &ldquo;ordained and
      established&rdquo; in the name of the people, &ldquo;in order to form a 
			more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and 
			secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity.&rdquo; 
			Nor did he consider the argument &ldquo;that the people had already 
			surrendered all their powers to the State Sovereignties and had nothing 
			more to give,&rdquo; a persuasive one, for &ldquo;surely, the question 
			whether they may resume and modify the power granted to the government 
			does not remain to be settled in this country. Much more might the 
			legitimacy of the General Government be doubted, had it been created by 
			the States. The powers delegated to the State sovereignties were to be 
			exercised by themselves, not by a distinct and independent sovereignty 
			created by them.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Government of the Union, then,&rdquo; 
			Marshall proceeded, &ldquo;is emphatically &hellip; a government of the
      people. In form and in substance it emanates from them. Its powers are
      granted by them, and are to be exercised on them, and for their 
			benefit.&rdquo; And what was the nature of this Government? &ldquo;If any 
			one proposition could command the universal assent of mankind we might 
			expect it would be this: that the government of the Union, though 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
			limited in its powers, is supreme within the sphere of its action. 
			This would seem to result necessarily from its nature. It is the 
			government of all; its powers are delegated by all; it represents 
			all and acts for all.&rdquo; However the question had not been left 
			to reason. &ldquo;The people have in express terms decided it by
      saying: &lsquo;This Constitution and the laws of the United States 
			which shall be made in pursuance thereof &hellip; shall be the 
			supreme Law of the Land.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But a Government which is supreme must have the right to choose the means
      by which to make its supremacy effective; and indeed, at this point again
      the Constitution comes to the aid of reason by declaring specifically that
      Congress may make all laws &ldquo;necessary and proper&rdquo; for carrying 
			into execution any of the powers of the General Government. Counsel for
      Maryland would read this clause as limiting the right which it recognized
      to the choice only of such means of execution as are indispensable; they
      would treat the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; as controlling the clause and 
			to this they would affix the word &ldquo;absolutely.&rdquo; &ldquo;Such 
			is the character of human language,&rdquo; rejoins the Chief Justice, 
			&ldquo;that no word conveys to the mind in all situations, one single 
			definite idea,&rdquo; and the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
			word &ldquo;necessary,&rdquo; &ldquo;like
      others, is used in various senses,&rdquo; so that its context becomes most
      material in determining its significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is its context on this occasion? &ldquo;The subject is the 
			execution of those great powers on which the welfare of a nation 
			essentially depends.&rdquo; The provision occurs &ldquo;in a Constitution 
			intended to endure for ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the 
			various crises of human affairs.&rdquo; The purpose of the clause 
			therefore is not to impair the right of Congress &ldquo;to exercise its 
			best judgment in the selection of measures to carry into execution the 
			constitutional powers of the Government,&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;to 
			remove all doubts respecting the right to legislate on that vast mass of 
			incidental powers which must be involved in the Constitution, if that 
			instrument be not a splendid bauble.&hellip; Let the end be legitimate,
      let it be within the scope of the Constitution and all means which are
      appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not
      prohibited but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are
      constitutional.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But was the Act of Maryland which taxed the Bank in conflict with the Act
      of Congress which established it? If so, must the State yield to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
			Congress? In approaching this question Marshall again laid the basis for 
			as sweeping a decision as possible. The terms in which the Maryland 
			statute was couched indicated clearly that it was directed specifically 
			against the Bank, and it might easily have been set aside on that ground. 
			But Marshall went much further and laid down the principle that the 
			instrumentalities of the National Government are never subject to 
			taxation by the States in any form whatsoever, and for two reasons. In 
			the first place, &ldquo;those means are not given by the people of a 
			particular State &hellip; but by the people of all the States. They are 
			given by all for the benefit of all,&rdquo; and owe their presence in the 
			State not to the State&rsquo;s permission but to a higher authority. The 
			State of Maryland therefore never had the power to tax the Bank in the 
			first place. Yet waiving this theory, there was, in the second place, 
			flat incompatibility between the Act of Maryland and the Act of
      Congress, not simply because of the specific operation of the former, but
      rather because of the implied claim which it made for state authority.
      &ldquo;That the power to tax involves the power to destroy,&rdquo; 
			Marshall continued; &ldquo;that the power to destroy may defeat and 
			render useless the power to create; that there is a plain 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
			repugnance in conferring on one government a power to control the 
			constitutional measures of another, which other, with respect to those 
			very measures is declared to be supreme over that which exerts the 
			control, are propositions not to be denied.&rdquo; Nor indeed is the
      sovereignty of the State confined to taxation. &ldquo;That is not the only 
			mode in which it might be displayed. The question is in truth, a question 
			of supremacy, and if the right of the States to tax the means employed by 
			the General Government be conceded, the declaration that the Constitution 
			and the laws made in pursuance thereof shall be supreme law of the land, 
			is empty and unmeaning declamation.&hellip; We are unanimously of 
			opinion,&rdquo; concluded the Chief Justice, &ldquo;that the law &hellip; 
			of Maryland, imposing a tax on the Bank of the United States is 
			unconstitutional and void.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years later, in the case of Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden, &sup1; known to
      contemporaries as the &ldquo;Steamboat case,&rdquo; Marshall received the 
			opportunity to apply his principles of constitutional construction to the 
			power of Congress to regulate &ldquo;commerce among the States.&rdquo; For 
			a quarter of a century Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
			their successors had
      enjoyed from the Legislature of New York a grant of the exclusive right to
      run steamboats on the waters of the State, and in this case one of their
      licensees, Ogden, was seeking to prevent Gibbons, who had steamers in the
      coasting trade under an Act of Congress, from operating them on the Hudson
      in trade between points in New York and New Jersey. A circumstance which
      made the case the more critical was that New Jersey and Connecticut had
      each passed retaliatory statutes excluding from their waters any vessel
      licensed under the Fulton-Livingston monopoly. The condition of interstate
      commercial warfare which thus threatened was not unlike that which had
      originally operated so potently to bring about the Constitution.

    <p>
      The case of Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden was argued in the early days of 
			February, 1824, with Attorney-General Wirt and Daniel Webster against the 
			grant, while two famous New York lawyers of the day, Thomas Addis Emmet, 
			brother of the Irish patriot, and Thomas J. Oakley, acted as Ogden&rsquo;s 
			counsel. The arguments have the importance necessarily attaching to a 
			careful examination of a novel legal question of the first magnitude by 
			learned and acute minds, but some of the claims that have been 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
			made for these arguments, and especially for Webster&rsquo;s effort, 
			hardly sustain investigation. Webster, never in any case apt to regard 
			his own performance overcritically, seems in later years to have been 
			persuaded that the Chief Justice&rsquo;s opinion &ldquo;followed closely 
			the track&rdquo; of his argument on this occasion; and it is true that 
			Marshall expressed sympathy with Webster&rsquo;s contention that Congress 
			may regulate as truly by inaction as by action, since inaction may 
			indicate its wish that the matter go unregulated; but the Chief Justice 
			did not explicitly adopt this idea, and the major part of his opinion was 
			a running refutation of Emmet&rsquo;s argument, which in turn was only an 
			elaboration of Chancellor Kent&rsquo;s opinion upon the same subject in 
			the New York courts. &sup1; In other words, this was one of those cases 
			in which Marshall&rsquo;s indebtedness to counsel was far less for ideas 
			than for the stimulation which his own powers always received from 
			discussion; and the result is his profoundest, most statesmanlike opinion, 
			from whose doctrines the Court has at times deviated, but only to return 
			to them, until today it is more nearly than ever before the established 
			law on the many points covered by its <i>dicta.</i>

      Marshall pronounced the Fulton-Livingston monopoly inoperative so far as
      it concerned vessels enrolled under the Act of Congress to engage in the
      coasting trade; but in arriving at this very simple result his opinion
      takes the broadest possible range. At the very outset Marshall flatly
      contradicts Kent&rsquo;s proposition that the powers of the General 
			Government, as representing a grant by sovereignties, must be strictly 
			construed. The Constitution, says he, &ldquo;contains an enumeration of 
			powers expressly granted by the people to their government,&rdquo; and 
			there is not a word in it which lends any countenance to the idea that 
			these powers should be strictly interpreted. As men whose intentions 
			required no concealment, those who framed and adopted the Constitution 
			&ldquo;must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense 
			and to have intended what they said&rdquo;; but if, from the inherent 
			imperfection of language, doubts were at any time to arise 
			&ldquo;respecting the extent of any given power,&rdquo; then the
      known purposes of the instrument should control the construction put on
      its phraseology. &ldquo;The grant does not convey power which might be
      beneficial to the grantor if retained by himself &hellip; but is an 
			investment of power for the general 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
			advantage in the hands of agents selected for the purpose, which power 
			can never be exercised by the people themselves, but must be placed in 
			the hands of agents or remain dormant.&rdquo; In no other of
      his opinions did Marshall so clearly bring out the logical connection
      between the principle of liberal construction of the Constitution and the
      doctrine that it is an ordinance of the American people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning then to the Constitution, Marshall asks, &ldquo;What is 
			commerce?&rdquo; &ldquo;Counsel for appellee,&rdquo; he recites, 
			&ldquo;would limit it to traffic, to buying and selling,&rdquo; 
			to which he answers that &ldquo;this would restrict a general term 
			&hellip; to one of its significations. Commerce,&rdquo; he continues,
      &ldquo;undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more&mdash;it is
      intercourse,&rdquo; and so includes navigation. And what is the power of
      Congress over commerce? &ldquo;It is the power to regulate, that is, the 
			power to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.&rdquo; 
			It is a power &ldquo;complete in itself,&rdquo; exercisable &ldquo;at its 
			utmost extent,&rdquo; and without limitations &ldquo;other than are 
			prescribed by the Constitution.&hellip; If, as has always been understood, 
			the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to specified objects, is 
			plenary as to those objects, the power over commerce with foreign nations 
			and among the several 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
			States is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single 
			government having in its constitution the same restrictions on the 
			exercise of power as are found in the Constitution of the United 
			States.&rdquo; The power, therefore, is not to be confined by state 
			lines but acts upon its subject-matter wherever it is to be found. 
			&ldquo;It may, of consequence, pass the jurisdictional line of New
      York and act upon the very waters to which the prohibition now under
      consideration applies.&rdquo; It is a power to be exercised within the 
			States and not merely at their frontiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was it sufficient for Marshall merely to define the power of Congress?
      Must not the power of the State also be considered? At least, Ogden&rsquo;s
      attorneys had argued, the mere existence in Congress of the power to
      regulate commerce among the States did not prevent New York from
      exercising the same power, through legislation operating upon subject
      matter within its own boundaries. No doubt, he concedes, the States have
      the right to enact many kinds of laws which will incidentally affect
      commerce among the States, such for instance as quarantine and health
      laws, laws regulating bridges and ferries, and so on; but this they do by
      virtue of their power of &ldquo;internal police,&rdquo; not by virtue 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
			of a &ldquo;concurrent&rdquo; power over commerce, foreign and interstate. 
			And, indeed, New York may have granted Fulton and Livingston their 
			monopoly in exercise of this power, in which case its validity would 
			depend upon its not conflicting with an Act of Congress regulating 
			commerce. For should such conflict exist, the State enactment, though 
			passed &ldquo;in the exercise of its acknowledged sovereignty,&rdquo; 
			must give place in consequence of the supremacy conferred by the 
			Constitution upon all acts of Congress in pursuance of it, over all 
			state laws whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion then proceeds to the consideration of the Act of Congress
      relied upon by Gibbons. This, Ogden&rsquo;s attorneys contended, merely
      conferred the American character upon vessels already possessed of the
      right to engage in the coasting trade; Marshall, on the contrary, held
      that it conferred the right itself, together with the auxiliary right of
      navigating the waters of the United States; whence it followed that New
      York was powerless to exclude Gibbons&rsquo;s vessels from the Hudson.
      Incidentally Marshall indicated his opinion that Congress&rsquo;s power 
			extended to the carriage of passengers as well as of goods and to vessels 
			propelled by steam as well as to those driven by wind. &ldquo;The one 
			element,&rdquo; 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
			said he, &ldquo;may be as legitimately used as the other for every 
			commercial purpose authorized by the laws of the Union.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years later, in the case of Brown <i>vs.</i> Maryland, &sup1; Marshall 
			laid down his famous doctrine that so long as goods introduced into a 
			State in the course of foreign trade remain in the hands of the importer 
			and in the original package, they are not subject to taxation by the 
			State. This doctrine is interesting for two reasons. In the first place, 
			it implies the further principle that an attempt by a State to tax 
			interstate or foreign commerce is tantamount to an attempt to regulate 
			such commerce, and is consequently void. In other words, the principle of 
			the exclusiveness of Congress&rsquo;s power to regulate commerce among the 
			States and with foreign nations, which is advanced by way of <i>dictum</i> 
			in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden, becomes in Brown <i>vs.</i> Maryland a ground 
			of decision. It is a principle which has proved of the utmost importance 
			in keeping the field of national power clear of encumbering state 
			legislation against the day when Congress should elect to step in and 
			assume effective control. Nor can there be much doubt that the result was 
			intended by the framers of the Constitution.

    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
      In the second place, however, from another point of view this 
			&ldquo;original package doctrine&rdquo; is only an extension of the 
			immunity from state taxation established in M&rsquo;Culloch <i>vs.</i> 
			Maryland for instrumentalities of the National Government. It thus 
			reflects the principle implied by that decision: where power exists to 
			any degree or for any purpose, it exists to every degree and for every 
			purpose; or, to quote Marshall&rsquo;s own words in Brown <i>vs.</i> 
			Maryland, &ldquo;questions of power do not depend upon the degree
      to which it may be exercised; if it may be exercised at all, it may be
      exercised at the will of those in whose hands it is placed.&rdquo; The 
			attitude of the Court nowadays, when it has to deal with state 
			legislation, is very different. It takes the position that abuse of 
			power, in relation to private rights or to commerce, is excess of power 
			and hence demands to be shown the substantial effect of legislation, not 
			its mere formal justification. &sup1; In short, its inquiry is into 
			facts. On the other hand, when dealing with congressional legislation, 
			the Court has hitherto always followed Marshall&rsquo;s bolder method. 
			Thus Congress may use its taxing 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
			power to drive out unwholesome 
			businesses, perhaps even to regulate labor within the States, and it may 
			close the channels of interstate and foreign commerce to articles 
			deemed by it injurious to the public health or morals. &sup2; To date 
			this discrepancy between the methods employed by the Court in passing 
			upon the validity of legislation within the two fields of state and 
			national power has afforded the latter a decided advantage.

      The great principles which Marshall developed in his interpretation of the
      Constitution from the side of national power and which after various ups
      and downs may be reckoned as part of the law of the land today, were the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The Constitution is an ordinance of the people of the United States,
      and not a compact of States.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Consequently it is to be interpreted with a view to securing a
      beneficial use of the powers which it creates, not with the purpose of
      safeguarding the prerogatives of state sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Constitution was further designed, as near as may be, &ldquo;for
      immortality,&rdquo; and hence was to be &ldquo;adapted to the various 
			crises of human affairs,&rdquo; to be kept a commodious vehicle of the 
			national life and not made the Procrustean bed of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. While the government which the Constitution 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
			established is one of
      enumerated powers, as to those powers it is a sovereign government, both
      in its choice of the means by which to exercise its powers and in its
      supremacy over all colliding or antagonistic powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The power of Congress to regulate commerce is an exclusive power, so
      that the States may not intrude upon this field even though Congress has
      not acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The National Government and its instrumentalities are present within
      the States, not by the tolerance of the States, but by the supreme
      authority of the people of the United States. &sup1;

      Of these several principles, the first is obviously the most important and
      to a great extent the source of the others. It is the principle of which
      Marshall, in face of the rising tide of State Rights, felt himself to be
      in a peculiar sense the official custodian. It is the principle which he
      had in mind in his noble plea at the close of the case of Gibbons 
			<i>vs.</i> Ogden for a construction of the Constitution capable of 
			maintaining its vitality and usefulness:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Powerful and ingenious minds [run his words], taking as postulates that
      the powers expressly granted to the Government of the Union are to be
      contracted by construction into the narrowest possible compass and that
      the original powers of the States are to be retained if any possible
      construction will retain them, may by a course 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
			of refined and metaphysical reasoning &hellip; explain away the 
			Constitution of our country and leave it a magnificent structure 
			indeed to look at, but totally unfit for use. They may so entangle 
			and perplex the understanding as to obscure principles which were 
			before thought quite plain, and induce doubts where, if the mind 
			were to pursue its own course, none would be perceived. In such a
      case, it is peculiarly necessary to recur to safe and fundamental
      principles.

      <span class="smcap">Marshall&rsquo;s</span> work was one of conservation 
			in so far as it was concerned with interpreting the Constitution in accord 
			with the intention which its framers had of establishing an efficient 
			National Government. But he found a task of restoration awaiting him in 
			that great field of Constitutional Law which defines state powers in 
			relation to private rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide adequate safeguards for property and contracts against state
      legislative power was one of the most important objects of the framers, if
      indeed it was not the most important. Consider, for instance, a colloquy
      which occurred early in the Convention between Madison and Sherman of
      Connecticut. The latter had enumerated &ldquo;the objects of Union&rdquo; 
			as follows: &ldquo;First, defense against foreign danger; secondly, 
			against internal disputes and a resort to force; thirdly, treaties with 
			foreign 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
			nations; fourthly, regulating foreign commerce and drawing revenue 
			from it.&rdquo; To this statement Madison demurred. The objects mentioned 
			were important, he admitted, but he &ldquo;combined with them the 
			necessity of providing more effectually for the securing of private rights 
			and the steady dispensation of justice. Interferences with these were 
			evils which had, more perhaps than anything else, produced this 
			Convention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s sympathy with this point of view we have already noted. 
			&sup1; Nor was Madison&rsquo;s reference solely to the then recent 
			activity of state Legislatures in behalf of the much embarrassed but 
			politically dominant small farmer class. He had also in mind that other 
			and more ancient practice of Legislatures of enacting so-called 
			&ldquo;special legislation,&rdquo; that is, legislation altering under 
			the standing law the rights of designated parties, and not infrequently 
			to their serious detriment. Usually such legislation took the form of 
			an intervention by the Legislature in private controversies pending in, 
			or already decided by, the ordinary courts, with the result that 
			judgments were set aside, executions canceled, new hearings granted, 
			new rules of evidence introduced, void wills validated, valid contracts 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
			voided, forfeitures pronounced&mdash;all by legislative mandate. Since 
			that day the courts have developed an interpretation of the principle of 
			the separation of powers and have enunciated a theory of &ldquo;due
      process of law,&rdquo; which renders this sort of legislative abuse quite
      impossible; but in 1787, though the principle of the separation of powers
      had received verbal recognition in several of the state Constitutions, no
      one as yet knew precisely what the term &ldquo;legislative power&rdquo; 
			signified, and at that time judicial review did not exist. &sup2; Hence 
			those who wished to see this nuisance of special legislation abated felt 
			not unnaturally that the relief must come from some source external to the 
			local governments, and they welcomed the movement for a new national 
			Constitution as affording them their opportunity.

    <p>
      The Constitution, in Article I, Section X, forbids the States to 
			&ldquo;emit bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver a legal 
			tender in payment of debts, pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, 
			or law impairing the obligation of contracts.&rdquo; Until 1798, the 
			provision generally regarded as offering the most promising weapon against 
			special
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
      legislation was the <i>ex post facto</i> clause. In that year, however, in 
			its decision in Calder <i>vs.</i> Bull the Court held that this clause 
			&ldquo;was not inserted to secure the citizen in his private rights of 
			either property or contracts,&rdquo; but only against certain kinds of 
			penal legislation. The decision roused sharp criticism and the judges 
			themselves seemed fairly to repent of it even in handing it down. 
			Justice Chase, indeed, even went so far as to suggest, as a sort of 
			stop-gap to the breach they were thus creating in the Constitution, the 
			idea that, even in the absence of written constitutional restrictions, 
			the Social Compact as well as &ldquo;the principles of our free 
			republican governments&rdquo; afforded judicially enforcible limitations 
			upon legislative power in favor of private rights. Then, in the years 
			immediately following, several state courts, building upon this dictum, 
			had definitely announced their intention of treating as void all 
			legislation which they found unduly to disturb vested rights, especially 
			if it was confined in its operation to specified parties. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_150-1" name="footer_150-1"></a>
				&sup1; In connection with this paragraph, see the writer&rsquo;s article
				entitled <i>The Basic Doctrine of American Constitutional Law,</i> in
				the <i>Michigan Law Review,</i> February, 1914. Marshall once wrote 
				Story regarding his attitude toward Section X in 1787, as follows: 
				&ldquo;The questions which were perpetually recurring in the State 
				legislatures and which brought annually into doubt principles which I 
				thought most sacred, which proved that everything was afloat, and that 
				we had no safe anchorage ground, gave a high value in my estimation to 
				that article of the Constitution which imposes restrictions on the 
				States.&rdquo; <i>Discourse.</i>
    </p>
		</div>

    <p>
      Such was still the situation when the case of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
			Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck &sup1; 
			in 1810 raised before the Supreme Court the question whether the Georgia
      Legislature had the right to rescind a land grant made by a preceding
      Legislature. On any of three grounds Marshall might easily have disposed
      of this case before coming to the principal question. In the first place,
      it was palpably a moot case; that is to say, it was to the interest of the
      opposing parties to have the rescinding act set aside. The Court would not
      today take jurisdiction of such a case, but Marshall does not even suggest
      such a solution of the question, though Justice Johnson does in his
      concurring opinion. In the second place, Georgia&rsquo;s own claim to the 
      lands had been most questionable, and consequently her right to grant them
      to others was equally dubious; but this, too, is an issue which Marshall
      avoids. Finally, the grant had been procured by corrupt means, but
      Marshall ruled that this was not a subject the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
			Court might enter upon; and
      for the ordinary run of cases in which undue influence is alleged to have
      induced the enactment of a law, the ruling is clearly sound. But this was
      no ordinary case. The fraud asserted against the grant was a matter of
      universal notoriety; it was, indeed, the most resounding scandal of the
      generation; and surely judges may assume to know what is known to all and
      may act upon their knowledge.

    </p>
		</div>

    <p>
      Furthermore, when one turns to the part of Marshall&rsquo;s opinion which 
			deals with the constitutional issue, one finds not a little evidence of 
			personal predilection on the part of the Chief Justice. He starts out by 
			declaring the rescinding act void as a violation of vested rights, of the 
			underlying principles of society and government, and of the doctrine of 
			the separation of powers. Then he apparently realizes that a decision 
			based on such grounds must be far less secure and much less generally 
			available than one based on the words of the Constitution; whereupon he 
			brings forward the obligation of contracts clause. At once, however, he is
      confronted with the difficulty that the obligation of a contract is the
      obligation of a contract still to be fulfilled, and that a grant is an
      executed contract over and done with&mdash;<i>functus officio.</i> This
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
      difficulty he meets by asserting that every grant is attended by an
      implied contract on the part of the grantor not to reassert his right to
      the thing granted. This, of course, is a palpable fiction on 
			Marshall&rsquo;s part, though certainly not an unreasonable one. For 
			undoubtedly when a grant is made without stipulation to the contrary, 
			both parties assume that it will be permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater difficulty arose from the fact that, whether implied or
      explicit, the contract before the Court was a <em>public</em> one. In the 
			case of private contracts it is easy enough to distinguish the contract, 
			as the agreement between the parties, from the obligation of the contract 
			which comes from the law and holds the parties to their engagements. But 
			what law was there to hold Georgia to her supposed agreement not to 
			rescind the grant she had made? Not the Constitution of the United States 
			unattended by any other law, since it protects the obligation only after 
			it has come into existence. Not the Constitution of Georgia as construed 
			by her own courts, since they had sustained the rescinding act. Only one 
			possibility remained; the State Constitution must be the source of the 
			obligation&mdash;yes; but the State Constitution as it was construed by 
			the United States Supreme 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
			Court in this very case, in the light of the 
			&ldquo;general principles of our political institutions.&rdquo; In short 
			the obligation is a moral one; and this moral obligation is treated by 
			Marshall as having been converted into a legal one by the United States 
			Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Marshall apparently fails to find entire satisfaction in this
      argument, for he next turns to the prohibition against bills of attainder
      and <i>ex post facto</i> laws with a question which manifests disapproval 
			of the decision in Calder <i>vs.</i> Bull. Yet he hesitates to overrule 
			Calder <i>vs.</i> Bull, and, indeed, even at the very end of his opinion 
			he still declines to indicate clearly the basis of his decision. The 
			State of Georgia, he says, &ldquo;was restrained&rdquo; from the passing 
			of the rescinding act &ldquo;either by general principles which are 
			common to our free institutions, or by particular provisions of the 
			Constitution of the United States.&rdquo; It was not until nine years 
			after Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck that this ambiguity was cleared up in the 
			Dartmouth College case in 1819.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of the Trustees of Dartmouth College <i>vs.</i> Woodward &sup1; 
			was a New England product and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
			redolent of the soil from which it sprang. In 1754 the Reverend 
			Eleazar Wheelock of Connecticut had established at his own expense 
			a charity school for instructing Indians in the Christian religion; 
			and so great was his success that he felt encouraged to extend
      the undertaking and to solicit donations in England. Again success
      rewarded his efforts; and in 1769 Governor Wentworth of New Hampshire,
      George III&rsquo;s representative granted the new institution, which was 
			now located at Hanover, New Hampshire, a charter incorporating twelve 
			named persons as &ldquo;The Trustees of Dartmouth College&rdquo; with the 
			power to govern the institution, appoint its officers, and fill all 
			vacancies in their own body &ldquo;forever.&rdquo;

      Though this form of worship occupied almost the position of a state
      religion in New Hampshire, early in this period difficulties arose in the
      midst of the church at Hanover. A certain Samuel Hayes, or Haze, told a
      woman named Rachel Murch that her character was &ldquo;as black as 
			Hell,&rdquo; and upon Rachel&rsquo;s complaint to the session, he was 
			&ldquo;churched&rdquo; for &ldquo;breach of the Ninth Commandment and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
			also for a violation of his covenant agreement.&rdquo; This incident 
			caused a rift which gradually developed into something very like a 
			schism in the local congregation, and this internal disagreement finally 
			produced a split between Eleazar&rsquo;s son, Dr. John Wheelock, who was
      now president of Dartmouth College, and the Trustees of the institution.
      The result was that in August, 1815, the Trustees ousted Wheelock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarrel had thus far involved only Calvinists and Federalists, but in
      1816 a new element was brought in by the interference of the Governor of
      New Hampshire, William Plumer, formerly a Federalist but now, since 1812,
      the leader of the Jeffersonian party in the State. In a message to the
      Legislature dated June 6, 1816, Plumer drew the attention of that body to
      Dartmouth College. &ldquo;All literary establishments,&rdquo; said he, 
			&ldquo;like everything human, if not duly attended to, are subject to 
			decay.&hellip; As it [the charter of the College] emanated from royalty, 
			it contained, as was natural it should, principles congenial to 
			monarchy,&rdquo; and he cited particularly the power of the Board of 
			Trustees to perpetuate itself. &ldquo;This last principle,&rdquo; he 
			continued, &ldquo;is hostile to the spirit and genius of a free 
			government. Sound policy 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
			therefore requires that the mode of election should be changed and that 
			Trustees in future should be elected by some other body of men.&hellip; 
			The College was formed for the <em>public</em> good, not for the benefit 
			or emolument of its Trustees; and the right to amend and improve acts of 
			incorporation of this nature has been exercised by all governments, 
			both monarchical and republican.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Plumer sent a copy of his message to Jefferson and received a
      characteristic answer in reply: &ldquo;It is replete,&rdquo; said the 
			Republican sage, &ldquo;with sound principles.&hellip; The idea that 
			institutions established for the use of the nation cannot be touched 
			nor modified, even to make them answer their end &hellip; is most 
			absurd.&hellip; Yet our lawyers and priests generally inculcate 
			this doctrine, and suppose that preceding generations held the
      earth more freely than we do; had a right to impose laws on us,
      unalterable by ourselves; &hellip; in fine, that the earth belongs to 
			the dead and not to the living.&rdquo; And so, too, apparently the 
			majority of the Legislature believed; for by the measure which it 
			promptly passed, in response to Plumer&rsquo;s message, the College 
			was made Dartmouth University, the number of its trustees was 
			increased to twenty-one, the appointment of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
			additional members being given to the Governor, and a board of
      overseers, also largely of gubernatorial appointment, was created to
      supervise all important acts of the trustees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends of the College at once denounced the measure as void under
      both the State and the United States Constitution and soon made up a test
      case. In order to obtain the college seal, charter, and records, a mandate
      was issued early in 1817 by a local court to attach goods, to the value of
      $50,000, belonging to William H. Woodward, the Secretary and Treasurer of
      the &ldquo;University.&rdquo; This was served by attaching a chair 
			&ldquo;valued at one dollar.&rdquo; The story is also related that 
			authorities of the College, apprehending an argument that the institution 
			had already forfeited its charter on account of having ceased to 
			minister to Indians, sent across into Canada for some of the aborigines, 
			and that three were brought down the river to receive matriculation, but 
			becoming panic-stricken as they neared the town, leaped into the water, 
			swam ashore, and disappeared in the forest. Unfortunately this 
			interesting tale has been seriously questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attorneys of the College before the Superior Court were Jeremiah
      Mason, one of the best lawyers of the day, Jeremiah Smith, a former Chief
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
      Justice of New Hampshire, and Daniel Webster. These three able lawyers
      argued that the amending act exceeded &ldquo;the rightful ends of 
			legislative power,&rdquo; violated the principle of the separation of 
			powers, and deprived the trustees of their &ldquo;privileges and 
			immunities&rdquo; contrary to the &ldquo;law of the land&rdquo; clause 
			of the State Constitution, and impaired the obligation of contracts. The 
			last contention stirred Woodward&rsquo;s attorneys, Bartlett and Sullivan, 
			to ridicule. &ldquo;By the same reasoning,&rdquo; said the latter, 
			&ldquo;every law must be considered in the nature of a contract, until 
			the Legislature would find themselves in such a labyrinth of contracts, 
			with the United States Constitution over their heads, that not a subject 
			would be left within their jurisdiction&rdquo;; the argument was an 
			expedient of desperation, he said, a &ldquo;last straw.&rdquo; The 
			principal contention advanced in behalf of the Act was that the College 
			was &ldquo;a public corporation,&rdquo; whose &ldquo;various powers, 
			capacities, and franchises all &hellip; were to be exercised for the
      benefit of the public,&rdquo; and were therefore subject to public 
			control. And the Court, in sustaining the Act, rested its decision on the 
			same ground.  Chief Justice Richardson conceded the doctrine of 
			Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck, that the obligation of contracts 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
			clause &ldquo;embraced all contracts relating to private property, 
			whether executed or executory, and whether between individuals, 
			between States, or between States and individuals,&rdquo; but, he urged, 
			&ldquo;a distinction is to be taken between particular grants by the
      Legislature of property or privileges to individuals for their own
      benefit, and grants of power and authority to be exercised for public
      purposes.&rdquo; Its public character, in short, left the College and its
      holdings at the disposal of the Legislature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the later proceedings, involving the appeal to Washington and the
      argument before Marshall, early in March, 1818, tradition has made Webster
      the central and compelling figure, and to the words which it assigns him
      in closing his address before the Court has largely been attributed the
      great legal triumph which presently followed. The story is, at least, so
      well found that the chronicler of Dartmouth College <i>vs.</i> Woodward 
			who should venture to omit it must be a bold man indeed.
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      The argument ended [runs the tale], Mr. Webster stood for some moments
      silent before the Court, while every eye was fixed intently upon him. At
      length, addressing the Chief Justice, he proceeded thus: &ldquo;This, sir, 
			is my case. It is the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
			case &hellip; of every college in our land.&hellip; Sir, you may destroy 
			this little institution.&hellip; You may put it out. But if you do so,
      you must carry through your work! You must extinguish, one after another,
      all those greater lights of science, which, for more than a century have
      thrown their radiance over our land. It is, Sir, as I have said, a small
      college. And yet there are those who love it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, the feelings which he had thus far succeeded in keeping down, broke
      forth, his lips quivered; his firm cheeks trembled with emotion, his eyes
      filled with tears.&hellip; The court-room during these two or three 
			minutes presented an extraordinary spectacle. Chief Justice Marshall, with 
			his tall and gaunt figure bent over, as if to catch the slightest whisper, 
			the deep furrows of his cheek expanded with emotion, and his eyes suffused
      with tears; Mr. Justice Washington at his side, with small and emaciated
      frame, and countenance more like marble than I ever saw on any other human
      being.&hellip; There was not one among the strong-minded men of that 
			assembly who could think it unmanly to weep, when he saw standing before 
			him the man who had made such an argument, melted into the tenderness of 
			a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Webster had now recovered his composure, and, fixing his keen eyes on
      Chief Justice Marshall, said in that deep tone with which he sometimes
      thrilled the heart of an audience: &ldquo;Sir, I know not how others may 
			feel &hellip; but for myself, when I see my Alma Mater surrounded, like 
			C&aelig;sar in the Senate house, by those who are reiterating stab after 
			stab, I would not, for my right hand, have her turn to me and say, 
			<i>Et tu quoque mi fili!</i> And thou, too, my son!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
      Whether this extraordinary scene, first described thirty-four years
      afterward by a putative witness of it, ever really occurred or not, it is
      today impossible to say. &sup1; But at least it would be an error to 
			attribute to it great importance. From the same source we have it that at 
			Exeter, too, Webster had made the judges weep&mdash;yet they had gone out 
			and decided against him. Judges do not always decide the way they weep!

    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      Of the strictly legal part of his argument Webster himself has left us a
      synopsis. Fully three-quarters of it dealt with the questions which had
      been discussed by Mason before the State Supreme Court under the New
      Hampshire Constitution and was largely irrelevant to the great point at
      issue at Washington. Joseph Hopkinson, who was now associated with
      Webster, contributed far more to the content of Marshall&rsquo;s opinion; 
			yet he, too, left one important question entirely to the Chief 
			Justice&rsquo;s ingenuity, as will be indicated shortly. Fortunately for 
			the College its opponents were ill prepared to take advantage of the 
			vulnerable points of its defense. For some unknown reason, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
			Bartlett and Sullivan, who had
      carried the day at Exeter, had now given place to William Wirt and John
      Holmes. Of these the former had just been made Attorney-General of the
      United States and had no time to give to the case&mdash;indeed he admitted
      that &ldquo;he had hardly thought of it till it was called on.&rdquo; As 
			for Holmes, he was a &ldquo;kaleidoscopic politician&rdquo; and barroom 
			wit, best known to contemporaries as &ldquo;the noisy eulogist and 
			reputed prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jefferson.&rdquo; A remarkable strategy 
			that, which stood such a person up before John Marshall to plead the right 
			of state Legislatures to dictate the fortunes of liberal institutions!
    </p>
    <p>
      The arguments were concluded on Thursday, the 12th of March. The next
      morning the Chief Justice announced that the Court had conferred, that
      there were different opinions, that some of the judges had not arrived at
      a conclusion, and that consequently the cause must be continued. Webster,
      however, who was apt to be much in &ldquo;the know&rdquo; of such matters, 
			ventured to place the different judges thus: &ldquo;The Chief and 
			Washington,&rdquo; he wrote his former colleague Smith, &ldquo;I have no 
			doubt, are with us. Duvall and Todd perhaps against us; the other three 
			holding up&mdash;I cannot much doubt but that Story will be with us in the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
			end, and I think we have much more
      than an even chance for one of the others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends of the College set promptly to work to bring over the wavering
      judges. To their dismay they learned that Chancellor James Kent of New
      York, whose views were known to have great weight with Justices Johnson
      and Livingston, had expressed himself as convinced by Chief Justice
      Richardson&rsquo;s opinion that Dartmouth College was a public corporation.
      Fortunately, however, a little ransacking of the records brought to light
      an opinion which Kent and Livingston had both signed as early as 1803,
      when they were members of the New York Council of Revision, and which took
      the ground that a then pending measure in the New York Legislature for
      altering the Charter of New York City violated &ldquo;due process of 
			law.&rdquo; At the same time, Charles Marsh, a friend of both Kent and 
			Webster, brought to the attention of the former Webster&rsquo;s argument 
			before Marshall at Washington in March, 1818. Then came a series of 
			conferences at Albany in which Chancellor Kent, Justice Johnson, President 
			Brown of Dartmouth College, Governor Clinton, and others participated. As 
			a result, the Chancellor owned himself converted to the idea that the 
			College was a private institution.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
      The new term of court opened on Monday, February 1, 1819. William Pinkney,
      who in vacation had accepted a retainer from the backers of Woodward, that
      is, of the State, took his stand on the second day near the Chief Justice,
      expecting to move for a reargument. Marshall, &ldquo;turning his blind 
			eye&rdquo; to the distinguished Marylander, announced that the Court had 
			reached a decision, plucked from his sleeve an eighteen folio manuscript 
			opinion, and began reading it. He held that the College was a 
			&ldquo;private eleemosynary institution&rdquo;; that its charter was the 
			outgrowth of a contract between the original donors and the Crown, that 
			the trustees represented the interest of the donors, and that the terms of 
			the Constitution were broad enough to cover and protect this 
			representative interest. The last was the only point on which he confessed 
			a real difficulty. The primary purpose of the constitutional clause, he 
			owned, was to protect &ldquo;contracts the parties to which have a vested 
			beneficial interest&rdquo; in them, whereas the trustees had no such 
			interest at stake. But, said he, the case is within the words of the rule, 
			and &ldquo;must be within its operation likewise, unless there be 
			something in the literal construction&rdquo; obviously at war with the 
			spirit of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
			Constitution, which was far from the fact. For, he continued, &ldquo;it
      requires no very critical examination of the human mind to enable us to
      determine that one great inducement to these gifts is the conviction felt
      by the giver that the disposition he makes of them is immutable. All such
      gifts are made in the pleasing, perhaps delusive hope, that the charity
      will flow forever in the channel which the givers have marked out for it.
      If every man finds in his own bosom strong evidence of the universality of
      this sentiment, there can be but little reason to imagine that the framers
      of our Constitution were strangers to it, and that, feeling the necessity
      and policy of giving permanence and security to contracts&rdquo; 
			generally, they yet deemed it desirable to leave this sort of contract 
			subject to legislative interference. Such is Marshall&rsquo;s answer to 
			Jefferson&rsquo;s outburst against &ldquo;the dead hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Characteristically, Marshall nowhere cites Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck in his
      opinion, but he builds on the construction there made of the 
			&ldquo;obligation of contracts&rdquo; clause as clearly as do his 
			associates, Story and Washington, who cite it again and again in their 
			concurring opinion. Thus he concedes that the British Parliament, in 
			consequence of its unlimited power, might at any time before the 
			Revolution 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
			have annulled the charter of the College and so have disappointed the 
			hopes of the donors; but, he adds, &ldquo;<em>the perfidy of the 
			transaction would have been universally acknowledged</em>.&rdquo; Later 
			on, he further admits that at the time of the Revolution the people of 
			New Hampshire succeeded to &ldquo;the transcendent power of 
			Parliament,&rdquo; as well as to that of the King, with the result that
      a repeal of the charter before 1789 could have been contested only under
      the State Constitution. &ldquo;But the Constitution of the United 
			States,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;has imposed this additional 
			limitation, that the Legislature of a State shall pass no act 
			&lsquo;impairing the obligation of contracts.&rsquo;&rdquo; In short, 
			as in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck, what was originally a moral obligation is
      regarded as having been lifted by the Constitution into the full status of
      a legal one, and this time without any assistance from &ldquo;the general
      principles of our free institutions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How is the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dartmouth College
      <i>vs.</i> Woodward to be assessed today? Logically the basis of it was
      repudiated by the Court itself within a decade, albeit the rule it lays
      down remained unaffected. Historically it is equally without basis, for
      the intention of the obligation of contracts clause, as the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
			evidence amply shows, was to protect private executory contracts, and 
			especially contracts of debt. &sup1; In actual practice, on the other 
			hand, the decision produced one considerable benefit: in the words of a 
			contemporary critic, it put private institutions of learning and charity 
			out of the reach of &ldquo;legislative despotism and party 
			violence.&rdquo;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_168-1" name="footer_168-1"></a>
				&sup1; Much of the evidence is readily traceable through the Index to
				Max Farrand&rsquo;s <i>Records of the Federal Convention.</i>
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      But doubtless, the critic will urge, by the same sign this decision also
      put profit-seeking corporations beyond wholesome legislative control. But
      is this a fact? To begin with, such a criticism is clearly misdirected. As
      we have just seen, the New Hampshire Superior Court itself would have felt
      that Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck left it no option but to declare the 
			amending act void, had Dartmouth College been, say, a gas company; and 
			this was in all probability the universal view of bench and bar in 1819. 
			Whatever blame there is should therefore be awarded the earlier decision. 
			But, in the second place, there does not appear after all to be so great 
			measure of blame to be awarded. The opinion in Dartmouth College 
			<i>vs.</i> Woodward leaves it perfectly clear that legislatures may 
			reserve the right to alter or repeal at will the charters they grant. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
			If therefore alterations and repeals have not been as frequent as public 
			policy has demanded, whose fault is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, however, it will be argued that the real mischief of the decision
      has consisted in its effect upon the state Legislatures themselves, the
      idea being that large business interests, when offered the opportunity of
      obtaining irrepealable charters, have frequently found it worth their
      while to assail frail legislative virtue with irresistible temptation. The
      answer to this charge is a &ldquo;confession in avoidance&rdquo;; the 
			facts alleged are true enough but hardly to the point. Yet even if they 
			were, what is to be said of that other not uncommon incident of 
			legislative history, the legislative &ldquo;strike,&rdquo; whereby 
			corporations not protected by irrepealable charters are blandly 
			confronted with the alternative of having their franchises mutilated or of 
			paying handsomely for their immunity? So the issue seems to resolve itself 
			into a question of taste regarding two species of legislative 
			&ldquo;honesty.&rdquo; Does one prefer that species which, in the words of 
			the late Speaker Reed, manifests itself in &ldquo;staying bought,&rdquo;
      or that species which flowers in legislative blackmail? The truth of the
      matter is that Marshall&rsquo;s decision has been condemned by 
			ill-informed or
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
      ill-intentioned critics for evils which are much more simply and much more
      adequately explained by general human cupidity and by the power inherent
      in capital. These are evils which have been experienced quite as fully in
      other countries which never heard of the &ldquo;obligation of 
			contracts&rdquo; clause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decisions reached in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck and Dartmouth College 
			<i>vs.</i> Woodward are important episodes in a significant phase of 
			American constitutional history. Partly on account of the lack of 
			distinction between legislative and judicial power and partly on account 
			of the influence of the notion of parliamentary sovereignty, legislative 
			bodies at the close of the eighteenth century were the sources of much 
			anonymous and corporate despotism. Even in England as well as in this 
			country the value, and indeed the possibility, of representative 
			institutions had been frankly challenged in the name of liberty. For the 
			United States the problem of making legislative power livable and 
			tolerable&mdash;a problem made the more acute by the multiplicity of 
			legislative bodies&mdash;was partly solved by the establishment of 
			judicial review. But this was only the first step: legislative power had 
			still to be defined and confined. Marshall&rsquo;s audacity in invoking 
			generally recognized moral principles
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
      against legislative sovereignty in his interpretation of the 
			&ldquo;obligation of contracts&rdquo; clause pointed the way to the 
			American judiciaries for the discharge of their task of defining 
			legislative power. The final result is to be seen today in the Supreme 
			Court&rsquo;s concept of the police power of a State as a power not of 
			arbitrary but of reasonable legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Marshall was performing this service in behalf of representative
      government, he was also aiding the cause of nationalism by accustoming
      certain types of property to look upon the National Government as their
      natural champion against the power of the States. In this connection it
      should also be recalled that Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden and Brown <i>vs.</i> 
			Maryland had advanced the principle of the exclusiveness of 
			Congress&rsquo;s power over foreign and interstate commerce. Under the 
			shelter of this interpretation there developed, in the railroad and 
			transportation business of the country before the Civil War, a property 
			interest almost as extensive as that which supported the doctrine of 
			State Rights. Nor can it be well doubted that Marshall designed some such 
			result or that he aimed to prompt the reflection voiced by King of 
			Massachusetts on the floor of the Federal Convention. &ldquo;He was 
			filled with astonishment that, if we 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
			were convinced that every <em>man</em> in America was secured in all 
			his rights, we should be ready to sacrifice this substantial good to 
			the phantom of <em>state</em> sovereignty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, these decisions brought a certain theoretical support to the
      Union. Marshall himself did not regard the Constitution as a compact
      between the States; if a compact at all, it was a compact among
      individuals, a social compact. But a great and increasing number of his
      countrymen took the other view. How unsafe, then, it would have been from
      the standpoint of one concerned for the integrity of the Union, to
      distinguish public contracts from private on the ground that the former,
      in the view of the Constitution, had less obligation!

      <span class="smcap">Marshall&rsquo;s</span> reading of the Constitution 
			may be summarized in a phrase: it transfixed State Sovereignty with a 
			two-edged sword, one edge of which was inscribed &ldquo;National 
			Supremacy,&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;Private Rights.&rdquo; 
			Yet State Sovereignty, ever reanimated by the democratic impulse of the

      Legislatures the right to interpret the Constitution with authoritative
      finality; but its argumentative resources were still far from exhausted,
      and its political resources were steadily increasing. It was still capable
      of making a notable resistance even in withdrawing itself, until it paused
      in its recoil and flung itself forward in a new attack.

    <p>
      The connecting link between the Supreme Court and the state courts has
      already been pointed out 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
			to be Section XXV of the Act of 1789 organizing the Federal Judiciary.

			Constitution itself, the highest state court into which the case can 
			come must either sustain such a claim or consent to have its decision
      reviewed, and possibly reversed, by the Supreme Court. The defenders of
      State Rights at first applauded this arrangement because it left to the
      local courts the privilege of sharing a jurisdiction which could have been
      claimed exclusively by the Federal Courts. But when State Rights began to
      grow into State Sovereignty, a different attitude developed, and in 1814
      the Virginia Court of Appeals, in the case of Hunter <i>vs.</i> Martin,
      &sup2; pronounced Section XXV void, though, in order not to encourage the
      disloyal tendencies then rampant in New England, the decision was not
      published until after the Treaty of Ghent, in February, 1815.

    <p>
      The head and front of the Virginia court at this time was Spencer Roane,
      described as &ldquo;the most 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
			powerful politician in the State,&rdquo; an ardent Jeffersonian, and an 
			enemy of Marshall on his own account, for had Ellsworth not resigned so 
			inopportunely, late in 1800, and had Jefferson had the appointment of his 
			successor, Roane would have been the man. His opinion in Hunter <i>vs.</i> 
			Martin disclosed personal animus in every line and was written with a 
			vehemence which was more likely to discomfit a grammarian than its 
			designed victims; but it was withal a highly ingenious plea. At one point 
			Roane enjoyed an advantage which would not be his today when so much more 
			gets into print, for the testimony of Madison&rsquo;s <i>Journal,</i> 
			which was not published till 1840, is flatly against him on the main 
			issue. In 1814, however, the most nearly contemporaneous evidence as 
			to the intention of the framers of the Constitution was that of the
      <i>Federalist,</i> which Roane stigmatizes as &ldquo;a mere 
			newspaper publication written in the heat and fury of the battle,&rdquo; 
			largely by &ldquo;a supposed favorer of a consolidated government.&rdquo; 
			This description not only overlooks the obvious effort of the authors of 
			the <i>Federalist</i> to allay the apprehensions of state jealousy 
			but it also conveniently ignores Madison&rsquo;s part in its composition. 
			Indeed, the <i>enfant terrible</i> of State Rights, the Madison of 
			1787-88, Roane 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
			would fain conceal behind the Madison of ten years later; and the 
			Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and the Report of 1799 he regards the 
			earliest &ldquo;just exposition of the principles of the
      Constitution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the question whether the Constitution gave &ldquo;any power to the 
			Supreme Court of the United States to reverse the judgment of the supreme 
			court of a State,&rdquo; Roane returned an emphatic negative. His 
			argument may be summarized thus: The language of Article III of the 
			Constitution does not regard the state courts as composing a part of the 
			judicial organization of the General Government; and the States, being 
			sovereign, cannot be stripped of their power merely by implication. 
			Conversely, the General Government is a government over individuals and 
			is therefore expected to exercise its powers solely through its own 
			organs. To be sure, the judicial power of the United States extends to 
			&ldquo;all cases arising&rdquo; under the Constitution and the laws of 
			the United States. But in order to come within this description, a case 
			must not merely involve the construction of the Constitution or laws of 
			the United States; it must have been instituted in the United States 
			courts, and not in those of another Government. Further, the Constitution 
			and the acts of Congress &ldquo;in 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
			pursuance thereof&rdquo; are 
			&ldquo;the supreme law of the land,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the judges in
      every State&rdquo; are &ldquo;bound thereby, anything in the Constitution 
			or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.&rdquo; But they are 
			bound as state judges and only as such; and what the Constitution is, or 
			what acts of Congress are &ldquo;in pursuance&rdquo; of it, is for them 
			to declare without any correction or interference by the courts of 
			another jurisdiction. Indeed, it is through the power of its courts to 
			say finally what acts of Congress are constitutional and what are not, 
			that the State is able to exercise its right of arresting within its 
			boundaries unconstitutional measures of the General Government. For the 
			legislative nullification of such measures proposed by the Virginia and 
			Kentucky resolutions is thus substituted judicial nullification by the 
			local judiciaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Martin <i>vs.</i> Hunter&rsquo;s Lessee, &sup1; which was decided in 
			February, 1816, Story, speaking for the Court, undertook to answer Roane. 
			Roane&rsquo;s major premise he met with flat denial: &ldquo;It is a 
			mistake,&rdquo; he asserts, &ldquo;that the Constitution was not designed 
			to operate upon States in their corporate capacities. It is crowded with 
			provisions 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
			which restrain or annul the sovereignty of the States in some of the 
			highest branches of their prerogatives.&rdquo; The greater part of the 
			opinion, however, consisted of a minute examination of the language of 
			Article III of the Constitution. In brief, he pointed out that while 
			Congress &ldquo;may &hellip; establish&rdquo; inferior courts and, 
			therefore, may not, it was made imperative that the judicial power of the 
			United States &ldquo;shall extend to all cases arising &hellip; 
			under&rdquo; the Constitution and acts of Congress. If, therefore, 
			Congress should exercise its option and not establish inferior courts, 
			in what manner, he asked, could the purpose of the Constitution be 
			realized except by providing appeals from the state courts to the 
			United States Supreme Court? But more than that, the practical 
			consequences of the position taken by the Virginia Court of Appeals 
			effectually refuted it. That there should be as many versions of the 
			Constitution, laws, and treaties as there are States in the Union was 
			certainly never intended by the framers, nor yet that plaintiffs alone 
			should say when resort should be had to the national tribunals, which 
			were designed for the benefit of all.

      If Story&rsquo;s argument is defective at any point, it is in its

			&ldquo;cases arising under this Constitution,&rdquo; and this defect in 
			constitutional interpretation is supplied five years later in 
			Marshall&rsquo;s opinion in Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia. &sup1; The facts 
			of this famous case were as follows: Congress had established a lottery 
			for the District of Columbia, for which the Cohens had sold tickets in 
			Virginia. They had thus run foul of a state law prohibiting such 
			transactions and had been convicted of the offense in the Court of 
			Quarterly Sessions of Norfolk County and fined one hundred dollars. 
			From this judgment they were now appealing under Section XXV.

		</div>
    <p>
      Counsel for the State of Virginia again advanced the principles which had
      been developed by Roane in Hunter <i>vs.</i> Martin but urged in addition 
			that this particular appeal rendered Virginia a defendant contrary to 
			Article XI of the Amendments. Marshall&rsquo;s summary of their argument 
			at the outset of his opinion is characteristic: &ldquo;They 
			maintain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the nation does not possess a 
			department capable of restraining peaceably, and by authority of law, 
			any attempts which may be made by a part against the legitimate powers of 
			the whole, and that the government is reduced to the alternative of 
			submitting to such attempts or of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
			resisting them by force.
      They maintain that the Constitution of the United States has provided no
      tribunal for the final construction of itself or of the laws or treaties
      of the nation, but that this power must be exercised in the last resort by
      the courts of every State in the Union. That the Constitution, laws, and
      treaties may receive as many constructions as there are States; and that
      this is not a mischief, or, if a mischief, is irremediable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of such absurdities, Marshall continued, was a conception of
      State Sovereignty contradicted by the very words of the Constitution,
      which assert its supremacy, and that of all acts of Congress in pursuance
      of it, over all conflicting state laws whatsoever. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he 
			proceeded to say, &ldquo;is the authoritative language of the American 
			People, and if gentlemen please, of the American States. It marks, with 
			lines too strong to be mistaken, the characteristic distinction between 
			the Government of the Union and those of the States. The General 
			Government, though limited as to its objects, is supreme with respect to 
			those objects. This principle is a part of the Constitution, and if there 
			be any who deny its necessity, none can deny its authority.&rdquo; Nor 
			was this to say that the Constitution is unalterable. &ldquo;The 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
			people make the Constitution, and the
      people can unmake it. It is the creature of their own will, and lives only
      by their will. But this supreme and irresistible power to make or unmake
      resides only in the whole body of the people, not in any subdivision of
      them. The attempt of any of the parts to exercise it is usurpation, and
      ought to be repelled by those to whom the people have delegated their
      power of repelling it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Marshall had swept aside the irrelevant notion of State Sovereignty,
      he proceeded with the remainder of his argument without difficulty.
      Counsel for Virginia had contended that &ldquo;a case arising under the
      Constitution or a law must be one in which a party comes into court to
      demand something conferred on him by the Constitution or a law&rdquo;; but 
			this construction Marshall held to be &ldquo;too narrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;A 
			case in law or equity consists of the right of the one party as well as of 
			the other, and may truly be said to arise under the Constitution or a law 
			of the United States <em>whenever its correct decision depends on the 
			construction of either.</em>&rdquo; From this it followed that Section XXV 
			was a measure necessary and proper for extending the judicial power of the 
			United States appellately to such cases whenever they were first 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
			brought in a state court. Nor did Article XI of the Amendments nullify 
			the power thus conferred upon the Court in a case which the State itself 
			had instituted, for in such a case the appeal taken to the national 
			tribunal was only another stage in an action &ldquo;begun and 
			prosecuted,&rdquo; not against the State, but by the State. The 
			contention of Virginia was based upon the assumption that the Federal 
			and the State Judiciaries constituted independent systems for the 
			enforcement of the Constitution, the national laws, and treaties, and 
			such an assumption Marshall held to be erroneous. For the purposes of the 
			Constitution the United States &ldquo;form a single nation,&rdquo; and in
      effecting these purposes the Government of the Union may 
			&ldquo;legitimately control all individuals or governments within the 
			American territory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our opinion in the Bank Case,&rdquo; Marshall had written Story 
			from Richmond in 1819, a few weeks after M&rsquo;Culloch <i>vs.</i> 
			Maryland, &ldquo;has roused the sleeping spirit of Virginia, if indeed 
			it ever sleeps.&rdquo; Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia, in 1821, produced an 
			even more decided reaction. Jefferson, now in retirement, had long since 
			nursed his antipathy for the Federal Judiciary to the point of monomania. 
			It was in his eyes &ldquo;a subtle corps of sappers and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
			miners constantly working underground to undermine our confederated 
			fabric&rdquo;; and this latest assault upon the rights of the States 
			seemed to him, though perpetrated in the usual way, the most outrageous 
			of all: &ldquo;An opinion is huddled up in conclave, perhaps by a
      majority of one, delivered as if unanimous, and with the silent
      acquiescence of lazy or timid associates, by a crafty chief judge, who
      sophisticates the law to his own mind by the turn of his own 
			reasoning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roane, Jefferson&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;, was still more violent 
			and wrote a series of unrestrained papers at this time in the Richmond 
			<i>Enquirer,</i> under the pseudonym &ldquo;Algernon Sidney.&rdquo; 
			Alluding to these, Marshall wrote Story that &ldquo;their coarseness and 
			malignity would designate the author of them if he was not avowed.&rdquo; 
			Marshall himself thought to answer Roane, but quickly learned that the 
			Virginia press was closed to that side of the question. He got his 
			revenge, however, by obtaining the exclusion of Roane&rsquo;s effusions 
			from Hall&rsquo;s <i>Law Journal,</i> an influential legal periodical
      published in Philadelphia. But the personal aspect of the controversy was
      the least important. &ldquo;A deep design,&rdquo; Marshall again wrote his 
			colleague, &ldquo;to convert our Government into a mere league of States 
			has 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
			taken hold of a powerful and violent party in Virginia. The attack upon 
			the judiciary is in fact an attack upon the Union.&rdquo; Nor was 
			Virginia the only State where this movement was formidable, and an early 
			effort to repeal Section XXV was to be anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the antijudicial movement was extending to other States was indeed
      apparent. The decision in Sturges <i>vs.</i> Crowinshield &sup1; left for 
			several years the impression that the States could not pass bankruptcy 
			laws even for future contracts and consequently afforded a widespread 
			grievance. Ohio had defied the ruling in M&rsquo;Culloch <i>vs.</i> 
			Maryland, and her Treasurer was languishing in jail by the mandate of the 
			Federal Circuit Court. Kentucky had a still sharper grievance in the 
			decision in Green <i>vs.</i> Biddle, &sup2; which invalidated a policy 
			she had been pursuing for nearly a quarter of a century with reference to 
			squatters&rsquo; holdings; and what made the decision seem the more 
			outrageous was the mistaken belief that it had represented the views of 
			only a minority of the justices.

      The Legislatures of the aggrieved States were soon in full hue and cry at
      the heels of the Court; and from them the agitation quickly spread to
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
      Congress. &sup1; On December 12, 1821, Senator Johnson of Kentucky 
			proposed an amendment to the Constitution which was intended to 
			substitute the Senate for the Supreme Court in all constitutional 
			cases. In his elaborate speech in support of his proposition, Johnson 
			criticized at length the various decisions of the Court but especially 
			those grounded on its interpretation of the &ldquo;obligation of 
			contracts&rdquo; clause. More than that, however, he denied <i>in 
			toto</i> the rights of the Federal Courts to pass upon the 
			constitutionality either of acts of Congress or of state legislative
      measures. So long as judges were confined to the field of jurisprudence,
      the principles of which were established and immutable, judicial
      independence was all very well, said Johnson, but &ldquo;the science of 
			politics was still in its infancy&rdquo;; and in a republican system of 
			government its development should be entrusted to those organs which were 
			responsible to the people. Judges were of no better clay than other folk. 
			&ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;should they be considered any 
			more infallible, or their decisions any less subject to investigation 
			and revision?&rdquo; 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
			Furthermore, &ldquo;courts,
      like cities, and villages, or like legislative bodies, will sometimes have
      their leaders; and it may happen that a single individual will be the
      prime cause of a decision to overturn the deliberate act of a whole State
      or of the United States; yet we are admonished to receive their opinions
      as the ancients did the responses of the Delphic oracle, or the Jews, with
      more propriety, the communications from Heaven delivered by <i>Urim</i> 
			and <i>Thummim</i> to the High Priest of God&rsquo;s chosen people.&rdquo;

    <p>
      For several years after this, hardly a session of Congress convened in
      which there was not introduced some measure for the purpose either of
      curbing the Supreme Court or of curtailing Marshall&rsquo;s influence on 
			its decisions. One measure, for example, proposed the repeal of Section 
			XXV; another, the enlargement of the Court from seven to ten judges; 
			another, the requirement that any decision setting aside a state law must 
			have the concurrence of five out of seven judges; another, the allowance 
			of appeals to the Court on decisions adverse to the constitutionality of 
			state laws as well as on decisions sustaining them. Finally, in January, 
			1826, a bill enlarging the Court to ten judges passed the House by a vote 
			of 132 to 27.
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
      In the Senate, Rowan of Kentucky moved an amendment requiring in all cases
      the concurrence of seven of the proposed ten judges. In a speech which was
      typical of current criticism of the Court he bitterly assailed the judges
      for the protection they had given the Bank&mdash;that &ldquo;political
      juggernaut,&rdquo; that &ldquo;creature of the perverted corporate powers 
			of the Federal Government&rdquo;&mdash;and he described the Court itself 
			as &ldquo;placed above the control of the will of the people, in a state 
			of disconnection with them, inaccessible to the charities and sympathies 
			of human life.&rdquo; The amendment failed, however, and in the end the 
			bill itself was rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a proposition to swamp the Court which received the approval of
      four-fifths of the House of Representatives cannot be lightly dismissed as
      an aberration. Was it due to a fortuitous coalescence of local grievances,
      or was there a general underlying cause? That Marshall&rsquo;s principles 
			of constitutional law did not entirely accord with the political and 
			economic life of the nation at this period must be admitted. The Chief 
			Justice was at once behind his times and ahead of them. On the one hand, 
			he was behind his times because he failed to appreciate adequately the 
			fact that 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
			freedom was necessary to frontier communities in meeting their peculiar 
			problems&mdash;a freedom which the doctrine of State Rights promised 
			them&mdash;and so he had roused Kentucky&rsquo;s wrath by the pedantic 
			and, as the Court itself was presently forced to admit, unworkable 
			decision in Green <i>vs.</i> Biddle. Then on the other hand, the 
			nationalism of this period was of that negative kind which was better 
			content to worship the Constitution than to make a really serviceable 
			application of the national powers. After the War of 1812 the great and 
			growing task which confronted the rapidly expanding nation was that of 
			providing adequate transportation, and had the old federalism from which 
			Marshall derived his doctrines been at the helm, this task would 
			undoubtedly have been taken over by the National Government. By 
			Madison&rsquo;s veto of the Cumberland Road Bill, however, in 1816, this 
			enterprise was handed over to the States; and they eagerly seized upon 
			it after the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 and the perception of the 
			immense success of the venture. Later, to be sure, the panic of 1837 
			transferred the work of railroad and canal building to the hands of 
			private capital but, after all, without altering greatly the
      constitutional problem. For with corporations 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
			to be chartered, endowed
      with the power of eminent domain, and adequately regulated, local policy
      obviously called for widest latitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reformers are likely to count it a grievance that the courts do not trip
      over themselves in an endeavor to keep abreast with what is called
      &ldquo;progress.&rdquo; But the true function of courts is not to reform, 
			but to maintain a definite <i>status quo.</i> The Constitution defined a 
			<i>status quo</i> the fundamental principles of which Marshall considered 
			sacred. At the same time, even his obstinate loyalty to &ldquo;the 
			intentions of the framers&rdquo; was not impervious to facts nor unwilling 
			to come to terms with them, and a growing number of his associates were 
			ready to go considerably farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the agitation in Congress against the Court was at its height,
      Marshall handed down his decision in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden, and shortly 
			after, that in Osborn <i>vs.</i> United States Bank. &sup1; In the latter 
			case, which was initiated by the Bank, the plaintiff in error, who was 
			Treasurer of the State of Ohio, brought forward Article XI of the 
			Amendments to the Constitution as a bar to the action, but Marshall held 
			that this Amendment did not prevent a state officer from being sued for 
			acts 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
			done in excess of his rightful powers. He also reiterated and amplified 
			the principles of M&rsquo;Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland. Three years later 
			he gave his opinions in Brown <i>vs.</i> Maryland and Ogden <i>vs.</i> 
			Saunders. &sup2; In the former Marshall&rsquo;s opinion was dissented 
			from by a single associate, but in the latter the Chief Justice found 
			himself for the first and only time in his entire incumbency in the 
			r&ocirc;le of dissenter in a constitutional case. The decision of the 
			majority, speaking through Justice Washington, laid down the principle 
			that the obligation of a private executory contract cannot be said to be
      &ldquo;impaired&rdquo; in a constitutional sense by the adverse effect of 
			legislative acts antedating the making of the contract; and thus the 
			dangerous ambiguity of Sturges <i>vs.</i> Crowinshield was finally 
			resolved in favor of the States.

      In the course of the next few years the Court, speaking usually through
      the Chief Justice, decided several cases on principles favoring local
      interest, sometimes indeed curtailing the operation of previously
      established principles. For example, the Court held that, in the absence
      of specific legislation by Congress to the contrary, a State may erect a
      dam across navigable waters of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>

      Despite all these concessions which he made to the rising spirit of the
      times, Marshall found his last years to be among the most trying of his
      chief justiceship. Jackson, who was now President, felt himself the chosen
      organ of &ldquo;the People&rsquo;s will&rdquo; and was not disposed to 
			regard as binding anybody&rsquo;s interpretation of the Constitution 
			except his own. The West and Southwest, the pocket boroughs of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
			the new Administration, were now deep in
      land speculation and clamorous for financial expedients which the
      Constitution banned. John Taylor of Caroline had just finished his task of
      defining the principles of constitutional construction which were
      requisite to convert the Union into a league of States and had laid his
      work at the feet of Calhoun. Taylor was a candid man and frankly owned the
      historical difficulties in the way of carrying out his purpose; but
      Calhoun&rsquo;s less scrupulous dialectic swept aside every obstacle that 
			stood in the way of attributing to the States the completest sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Craig <i>vs.</i> Missouri (1830) &sup1; the Court was confronted with 
			a case in which a State had sought to evade the prohibition of the 
			Constitution against the emission of bills of credit by establishing loan 
			offices with authority to issue loan certificates intended to circulate 
			generally in dimensions of fifty cents to ten dollars and to be receivable 
			for taxes. A plainer violation of the Constitution would be difficult to 
			imagine. Yet Marshall&rsquo;s decision setting aside the act was followed 
			by a renewed effort to procure the repeal of Section XXV of the Judiciary 
			Act. The discussion of the proposal 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
			threw into interesting contrast two points of view. The
      opponents of this section insisted upon regarding constitutional cases as
      controversies between the United States and the States in their corporate
      capacities; its advocates, on the other hand, treated the section as an
      indispensable safeguard of private rights. In the end, the latter point of
      view prevailed: the bill to repeal, which had come up in the House, was
      rejected by a vote of 138 to 51, and of the latter number all but six came
      from Southern States, and more than half of them from natives of Virginia.

    <p>
      Meantime the Supreme Court had become involved in controversy with Georgia
      on account of a series of acts which that State had passed extending its
      jurisdiction over the Cherokee Indians in violation of the national
      treaties with this tribe. In Corn Tassel&rsquo;s case, the appellant from 
			the Georgia court to the United States Supreme Court was hanged in 
			defiance of a writ of error from the Court. In Cherokee Nation <i>vs.</i> 
			Georgia, the Court itself held that it had no jurisdiction. Finally, in 
			1832, in Worcester <i>vs.</i> Georgia, &sup1; the Court was confronted 
			squarely with the question of the validity of the Georgia acts. The State 
			put in no appearance, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
			the acts were pronounced void, and the decision went unenforced. When 
			Jackson was asked what effort the Executive Department would make to back 
			up the Court&rsquo;s mandate, he is reported to have said: &ldquo;John 
			Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Marshall began to see the Constitution and the Union crumbling before him.
      &ldquo;I yield slowly and reluctantly to the conviction,&rdquo; he wrote 
			Story, late in 1832, &ldquo;that our Constitution cannot last.&hellip; 
			Our opinions [in the South] are incompatible with a united government 
			even among ourselves. The Union has been prolonged this far by 
			miracles.&rdquo; A personal consideration sharpened his apprehension. 
			He saw old age at hand and was determined &ldquo;not to hazard the 
			disgrace of continuing in office a mere inefficient pageant,&rdquo; but 
			at the same time he desired some guarantee of the character
      of the person who was to succeed him. At first he thought of remaining
      until after the election of 1832; but Jackson&rsquo;s re&euml;lection made 
			him relinquish altogether the idea of resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later, in consequence of the Administration&rsquo;s vigorous
      measures against nullification in South Carolina, things were temporarily
      wearing a brighter aspect. Yet that the fundamental elements 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
			of the situation had been thereby altered, Marshall did not believe. 
			&ldquo;To men who think as you and I do,&rdquo; he wrote Story, toward 
			the end of 1834, &ldquo;the present is gloomy enough; and the future 
			presents no cheering prospect. In the South &hellip; those who support 
			the Executive do not support the Government. They sustain the personal 
			power of the President, but labor incessantly to impair the legitimate 
			powers of the Government. Those who oppose the rash and violent measures 
			of the Executive &hellip; are generally the bitter enemies of 
			Constitutional Government. Many of them are the avowed advocates of a 
			league; and those who do not go the whole length, go a great part of the 
			way. What can we hope for in such circumstances?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was one respect in which the significance of Marshall&rsquo;s
      achievement must have been as clear to himself as it was to his
      contemporaries. He had failed for the time being to establish his
      definition of national power, it is true, but he had made the Supreme
      Court one of the great political forces of the country. The very ferocity
      with which the pretensions of the Court were assailed in certain quarters
      was indirect proof of its power, but there was also direct testimony of a
      high order. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
			In 1830 Alexis de Tocqueville, the French statesman, visited the United 
			States just as the rough frontier democracy was coming into its own. Only 
			through the Supreme Court, in his opinion, were the forces of renewal and 
			growth thus liberated to be kept within the bounds set by existing 
			institutions. &ldquo;The peace, the prosperity, and the very existence of 
			the Union,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;are vested in the hands of the seven 
			Federal judges. Without them the Constitution would be a dead letter: the
      Executive appeals to them for assistance against the encroachments of the
      legislative power; the Legislature demands their protection against the
      assaults of the Executive; they defend the Union from the disobedience of
      the States, the States from the exaggerated claims of the Union, the
      public interest against private interests and the conservative spirit of
      stability against the fickleness of the democracy.&rdquo; The contrast 
			between these observations and the disheartened words in which Jay 
			declined renomination to the chief justiceship in 1801 gives perhaps a 
			fair measure of Marshall&rsquo;s accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the implications of the accomplishment of the great Chief Justice for
      the political life of the country, let De Tocqueville speak again:
      &ldquo;Scarcely any 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
			political question arises in the United States which is not resolved 
			sooner, or later, into a judicial question. Hence all parties are obliged 
			to borrow in their daily controversies the ideas, and even the language 
			peculiar to judicial proceedings.&hellip; The language of the law thus
      becomes, in some measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of law, which is
      produced in the schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond
      their walls into the bosom of society, where it descends to the lowest
      classes, so that at last the whole people contract the habits and the
      tastes of the judicial magistrate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect, however, De Tocqueville erred. American 
			&ldquo;legalism,&rdquo; that curious infusion of politics with 
			jurisprudence, that mutual consultation of public opinion and established 
			principles, which in the past has so characterized the course of 
			discussion and legislation in America, is traceable to origins long 
			antedating Marshall&rsquo;s chief justiceship. On the other hand, there 
			is no public career in American history which ever built so largely upon 
			this pervasive trait of the national outlook as did Marshall&rsquo;s, or 
			which has contributed so much to render it effective in palpable 
			institutions.

      <span class="smcap">It</span> is a circumstance of no little importance 
			that the founder of American Constitutional Law was in tastes and habit 
			of life a simple countryman. To the establishment of National Supremacy 
			and the Sanctity of Contracts Marshall brought the support not only of 
			his office and his command of the art of judicial reasoning but also the 
			whole-souled democracy and unpretentiousness of the fields. And it must 
			be borne in mind that Marshall was on view before his contemporaries as 
			a private citizen rather more of the time, perhaps, than as Chief Justice. 
			His official career was, in truth, a somewhat leisurely one. Until 1827 
			the term at Washington rarely lasted over six weeks and subsequently not 
			over ten weeks. In the course of his thirty-four years on the Bench, the 
			Court handed down opinions in over 1100 cases, which is probably about 
			four times the number of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
			opinions now handed down at a single term; and of this number Marshall
      spoke for the Court in about half the cases. Toward the middle of March,
      he left Washington for Richmond, and on the 22d of May opened court in his
      own circuit. Then, three weeks later, if the docket permitted, he went on
      to Raleigh to hold court there for a few days. The summers he usually
      spent on the estate which he inherited from his father at Fauquier, or
      else he went higher up into the mountains to escape malaria. But by the
      22d of November at the latest he was back once more in Richmond for court,
      and at the end of December for a second brief term he again drove to
      Raleigh in his high-wheeled gig. With his return to Washington early in
      February he completed the round of his judicial year.

      My dearest Polly
    </p>
    <p>
      You will laugh at my vexation when you hear the various calamities that
      have befallen me. In the first place when I came to review my funds, I had
      the mortification 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
			to discover that I had lost 15 silver dollars out of my
      waist coat pocket. They had worn through the various mendings the pocket
      had sustained and sought their liberty in the sands of Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined not to vex myself with what could not be remedied &amp;
      ordered Peter to take out my cloaths that I might dress for court when to
      my astonishment &amp; grief after fumbling several minutes in the
      portmanteau, starting [sic] at vacancy, &amp; sweating most profusely he
      turned to me with the doleful tidings that I had no pair of breeches. You
      may be sure this piece of intelligence was not very graciously received;
      however, after a little scolding, I determined to make the best of my
      situation &amp; immediately set out to get a pair made.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I should be a sans-culotte only one day &amp; that for the
      residue of the term I might be well enough dressed for the appearance on
      the first day to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, the greatest of evils, I found, was followed by still greater. Not a
      taylor in town could be prevailed on to work for me. They were all so busy
      that it was impossible to attend to my wants however pressing they might
      be, &amp; I have the extreme mortification to pass the whole time without
      that important article of dress I have mentioned. I have no alleviation
      for this misfortune but the hope that I shall be enabled in four or five
      days to commence my journey homeward &amp; that I shall have the pleasure
      of seeing you &amp; our dear children in eight or nine days after this
      reaches you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, I flatter myself that you are well and happy.

      Marshall erected his Richmond home, called &ldquo;Shockoe Hill,&rdquo; in
			1793 on a plot of ground which he had purchased four years earlier. Here, 
			as his eulogist has said, was &ldquo;the scene of his real 
			triumphs.&rdquo; At an early date his wife became a nervous invalid, and 
			his devotion to her brought out all the finest qualities of his sound and 
			tender nature. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; says Mr. Beveridge, &ldquo;the most 
			marked characteristic of his entire private life and is the one thing 
			which differentiates him sharply from the most eminent men of that heroic 
			but socially free-and-easy period.&rdquo; From his association with his 
			wife Marshall derived, moreover, an opinion of the sex &ldquo;as the 
			friends, the companions, and the equals of man&rdquo; which may be said to 
			have furnished one of his few points of sympathetic contact with
      American political radicalism in his later years. The satirist of woman,
      says Story, &ldquo;found no sympathy in his bosom,&rdquo; and &ldquo;he 
			was still farther above the commonplace flatteries by which frivolity 
			seeks to administer aliment to personal vanity, or vice to make its 
			approaches for baser purposes. He spoke to the sex when present, as he 
			spoke of them when absent, in language of just appeal to their 
			understandings, their tastes, and their duties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
      Marshall&rsquo;s relations with his neighbors were the happiest possible. 
			Every week, when his judicial duties permitted or the more 
			&ldquo;laborious relaxation&rdquo; of directing his farm did not call 
			him away, he attended the meetings of the Barbecue Club in a fine grove 
			just outside the city, to indulge in his favorite diversion of quoits. 
			The Club consisted of thirty of the most prominent men of Richmond, 
			judges, lawyers, doctors, clergymen, and merchants. To quoits was added 
			the inducement of an excellent repast of which roast pig was the 
			<i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance.</i> Then followed a dessert of 
			fruit and melons, while throughout a generous stock of porter, toddy, 
			and of punch &ldquo;from which water was carefully excluded,&rdquo;
      was always available to relieve thirst. An entertaining account of a
      meeting of the Club at which Marshall and his friend Wickham were the
      caterers has been thus preserved for us:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      At the table Marshall announced that at the last meeting two members had
      introduced politics, a forbidden subject, and had been fined a basket of
      champagne, and that this was now produced, as a warning to evil-doers; as
      the club seldom drank this article, they had no champagne glasses, and
      must drink it in tumblers. Those who played quoits retired after a while
      for a game. Most of the members had smooth, highly polished brass quoits.
      But Marshall&rsquo;s were large, rough, heavy, and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
			of iron, such as few of the members could throw well from hub to hub. 
			Marshall himself threw them with great success and accuracy, and 
			often &ldquo;rang the meg.&rdquo; On this occasion Marshall and the 
			Rev. Mr. Blair led the two parties of players. Marshall played first, 
			and rang the meg. Parson Blair did the same, and his quoit came down 
			plumply on top of Marshall&rsquo;s. There was uproarious applause,
      which drew out all the others from the dinner; and then came an animated
      controversy as to what should be the effect of this exploit. They all
      returned to the table, had another bottle of champagne, and listened to
      arguments, one from Marshall, pro se, and one from Wickham for Parson
      Blair. [Marshall&rsquo;s] argument is a humorous companion piece to any 
			one of his elaborate judicial opinions. He began by formulating the 
			question, &ldquo;Who is winner when the adversary quoits are on the meg 
			at the same time?&rdquo; He then stated the facts, and remarked that the 
			question was one of the true construction and applications of the rules 
			of the game. The first one ringing the meg has the advantage. No other 
			can succeed who does not begin by displacing this first one. The parson, 
			he willingly allowed, deserves to rise higher and higher in 
			everybody&rsquo;s esteem; but then he mustn&rsquo;t do it by getting on 
			another&rsquo;s back in this fashion. That is more like leapfrog than 
			quoits. Then, again, the legal maxim, <i>Cujus est solum, ejus est usque
      ad c&oelig;lum</i>&mdash;his own right as first occupant extends to the 
			vault of heaven; no opponent can gain any advantage by squatting on his 
			back. He must either bring a writ of ejectment, or drive him out <i>vi 
			et armis.</i> And then, after further argument of the same sort, he 
			asked judgment, and sat down amidst great applause. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
		</p>
		<p>	
			Mr. Wickham then rose, and made an argument of a similar pattern. 
			No rule, he said, requires an impossibility. Mr. Marshall&rsquo;s 
			quoit is twice as large as any other; and yet it flies from his
      arm like the iron ball at the Grecian games from the arm of Ajax. It is
      impossible for an ordinary quoit to move it. With much more of the same
      sort, he contended that it was a drawn game. After very animated voting,
      designed to keep up the uncertainty as long as possible, it was so
      decided. Another trial was had, and Marshall clearly won. &sup1;

      Years later Chester Harding, who once painted Marshall, visited the Club.
      &ldquo;I watched,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for the coming of the old chief. 
			He soon approached, with his coat on his arm and his hat in his hand, 
			which he was using as a fan. He walked directly up to a large bowl of 
			mint julep which had been prepared, and drank off a tumblerful, smacking 
			his lips, and then turned to the company with a cheerful &lsquo;How are 
			you, gentlemen?&rsquo; He was looked upon as the best pitcher of the

			down on his knees measuring the contested distance with a straw, with 
			as much earnestness as if it had been a point of law; and if he proved 
			to be in the right, the woods would ring with his triumphant 
			shout.&rdquo; &sup1; What Wellesley remarked of the younger Pitt may be
      repeated of Marshall, that &ldquo;unconscious of his superiority,&rdquo; 
			he &ldquo;plunged heedlessly into the mirth of the hour&rdquo; and was 
			endowed with &ldquo;a gay heart and social spirit beyond any man of his 
			time.&rdquo;

      As a hero of anecdotes Marshall almost rivals Lincoln. Many of the tales
      preserved are doubtless apocryphal, but this qualification hardly lessens
      their value as contemporary impressions of his character and habits. They
      show for what sort of anecdotes his familiarly known personality had an
      affinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief Justice&rsquo;s entire freedom from ostentation and the 
			gentleness with which he could rebuke it in others is illustrated in a 
			story often told. Going early to the market one morning he came upon a 
			youth who was fuming and swearing because he could get no one to carry 
			his turkey home for him. Marshall proffered his services. Arriving at 
			the house the young man asked, &ldquo;What shall I 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
			pay you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;it was
      on my way, and no trouble.&rdquo; As Marshall walked away, the young man
      inquired of a bystander, &ldquo;Who is that polite old man that brought 
			home my turkey for me?&rdquo; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; was the answer, 
			&ldquo;is Judge Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the same general character is an anecdote which has to do with a much
      earlier period when Marshall was still a practicing attorney. An old
      farmer who was involved in a lawsuit came to Richmond to attend its trial.
      &ldquo;Who is the best lawyer in Richmond?&rdquo; he asked of his host, 
			the innkeeper of the Eagle tavern. The latter pointed to a tall, ungainly, 
			bareheaded man who had just passed, eating cherries from his hat and 
			exchanging jests with other loiterers like himself. &ldquo;That is 
			he,&rdquo; said the innkeeper; &ldquo;John Marshall is his name.&rdquo; 
			But the old countryman, who had a hundred dollars in his pocket, 
			proposed to spend it on something more showy and employed a solemn, 
			black-coated, and much powdered bigwig. The latter turned out in
      due course to be a splendid illustration of the proverb that &ldquo;fine
      feathers do not make fine birds.&rdquo; This the crestfallen rustic soon
      discovered. Meantime he had listened with amazement and growing admiration
      to an argument by 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
			Marshall in a cause which came on before his own. He now
      went up to Marshall and, explaining his difficulty, offered him the five
      dollars which the exactions of the first attorney still left him, and
      besought his aid. With a humorous remark about the power of a black coat
      and powdered wig Marshall good-naturedly accepted the retainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The religious bent of the Chief Justice&rsquo;s mind is illustrated in 
			another story, which tells of his arriving toward the close of day at an 
			inn in one of the counties of Virginia, and falling in with some young 
			men who presently began ardently to debate the question of the truth or 
			falsity of the Christian religion. From six until eleven o&rsquo;clock the 
			young theologians argued keenly and ably on both sides of the question. 
			Finally one of the bolder spirits exclaimed that it was impossible to 
			overcome prejudices of long standing and, turning to the silent visitor, 
			asked: &ldquo;Well, my old gentleman, what do you think of these 
			things?&rdquo; To their amazement the &ldquo;old gentleman&rdquo; replied 
			for an hour in an eloquent and convincing defense of the Christian 
			religion, in which he answered in order every objection the young men had 
			uttered. So impressive was the simplicity and loftiness of his discourse 
			that the erstwhile critics were completely silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
      In truth, Marshall&rsquo;s was a reverent mind, and it sprang 
			instinctively to the defense of ideas and institutions whose value had 
			been tested. Unfortunately, in his <i>Life of Washington</i> Marshall 
			seems to have given this propensity a somewhat undue scope. There were 
			external difficulties in dealing with such a subject apart from those 
			inherent in a great biography, and Marshall&rsquo;s volumes proved to be 
			a general disappointment. Still hard pressed for funds wherewith to meet 
			his Fairfax investment, he undertook this work shortly after he became 
			Chief Justice, at the urgent solicitation of Judge Bushrod Washington, 
			the literary executor of his
      famous <ins title="Add period after uncle.">uncle.</ins>
			Marshall had hoped to make this incursion into the field of
      letters a very remunerative one, for he and Washington had counted on some
      thirty thousand subscribers for the work. The publishers however,
      succeeded in obtaining only about a quarter of that number, owing partly
      at least to the fact that Jefferson had no sooner learned of the
      enterprise than his jealous mind conceived the idea that the biography
      must be intended for partisan purposes. He accordingly gave the alarm to
      the Republican press and forbade the Federal postmasters to take orders
      for the book. At the same time he asked his friend Joel Barlow, then
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
      residing in Paris, to prepare a counterblast, for which he declared
      himself to be &ldquo;rich in materials.&rdquo; The author of the 
			<i>Columbiad,</i> however, declined this hazardous commission, 
			possibly because he was unwilling to stand sponsor for the malicious 
			recitals that afterwards saw light in the pages of the <i>Anas.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But apart from this external opposition to the biography, Marshall found a
      source of even keener disappointment in the literary defects due to the
      haste with which he had done his work. The first three volumes had
      appeared in 1804, the fourth in 1805, and the fifth, which is much the
      best, in 1807. Republican critics dwelt with no light hand upon the
      deficiencies of these volumes, and Marshall himself sadly owned that the
      &ldquo;inelegancies&rdquo; in the first were astonishingly numerous. But 
			the shortcomings of the work as a satisfactory biography are more notable 
			than its lapses in diction. By a design apparently meant to rival the
      improvisations of <i>Tristram Shandy,</i> the birth of the hero is 
			postponed for an entire volume, in which the author traces the settlement 
			of the country. At the opening of the second volume &ldquo;the birth of 
			young Mr. Washington&rdquo; is gravely announced, to be followed by an 
			account of the Father of his Country so devoid of intimate touches that it 
			might easily have 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
			been written by one who had never seen George Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, these pages of Marshall&rsquo;s do not lack acute historical
      judgments. He points out, for instance, that, if the Revolution had ended
      before the Articles of Confederation were adopted, permanent disunion
      might have ensued and that, faulty as it was, the Confederation 
			&ldquo;preserved the idea of Union until the good sense of the Nation 
			adopted a more efficient system.&rdquo; Again, in his account of the 
			events leading up to the Convention of 1787, Marshall rightly emphasizes 
			facts which subsequent writers have generally passed by with hardly any 
			mention, so that students may read this work with profit even today. But 
			the chief importance of these volumes lay, after all, in the additional 
			power which the author himself derived from the labor of their 
			preparation. In so extensive an undertaking Marshall received valuable 
			training for his later task of laying the foundations of Constitutional 
			Law in America. One of his chief assets on the bench, as we have already 
			seen, was his complete confidence in his own knowledge of the intentions 
			of the Constitution&mdash;a confidence which was grounded in the 
			consciousness that he had written the history of the 
			Constitution&rsquo;s framing.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
      Most of Marshall&rsquo;s correspondence, which is not voluminous, deals 
			with politics or legal matters. But there are letters in which the 
			personal side of the Chief Justice is revealed. He gives his friend 
			Story a touching account of the loss of two of his children. He praises 
			old friends and laments his inability to make new ones. He commends Jane
      Austen, whose novels he has just finished reading. &ldquo;Her 
			flights,&rdquo; he remarks, &ldquo;are not lofty, she does not soar on 
			eagle&rsquo;s wings, but she is pleasing, interesting, equable, and yet 
			amusing.&rdquo; He laments that he &ldquo;can no longer debate and yet 
			cannot apply his mind to anything else.&rdquo; One recalls Darwin&rsquo;s 
			similar lament that his scientific work had deprived him of all liking 
			for poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter, which Marshall wrote the year before his death to
      his grandson, a lad of fourteen or fifteen, is interesting for its views
      on a variety of subjects and is especially pleasing for its characteristic
      freedom from condescension:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      I had yesterday the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 29th of
      November, and am quite pleased with the course of study you are pursuing.
      Proficiency in Greek and Latin is indispensable to an accomplished
      scholar, and may be of great real advantage in our progress through human
      life. Cicero deserves to be studied still more for his talents than for
      the improvement in language 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
			to be derived from reading him. He was unquestionably, with the single 
			exception of Demosthenes, the greatest orator among the ancients. He was 
			too a profound Philosopher. His &ldquo;de officiis&rdquo; is among the 
			most valuable treatises I have ever seen in the Latin language.
    </p>
    <p>
      History is among the most essential departments of knowledge; and, to an
      American, the histories of England and of the United States are most
      instructive. Every man ought to be intimately acquainted with the history
      of his own country. Those of England and of the United States are so
      closely connected that the former seems to be introductory to the latter.
      They form one whole. Hume, as far as he goes, to the revolution of 1688,
      is generally thought the best Historian of England. Others have continued
      his narrative to a late period, and it will be necessary to read them
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no exercise of the mind from which more valuable improvement is
      to be drawn than from composition. In every situation of life the result
      of early practice will be valuable. Both in speaking and writing, the
      early habit of arranging our thoughts with regularity, so as to point them
      to the object to be proved, will be of great advantage. In both, clearness
      and precision are most essential qualities. The man who by seeking
      embellishment hazards confusion, is greatly mistaken in what constitutes
      good writing. The meaning ought never to be mistaken. Indeed the readers
      should never be obliged to search for it. The writer should always express
      himself so clearly as to make it impossible to misunderstand him. He
      should be comprehended without an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step towards writing and speaking clearly is 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
			to think clearly.
      Let the subject be perfectly understood, and a man will soon find words to
      convey his meaning to others. Blair, whose lectures are greatly and justly
      admired, advises a practice well worthy of being observed. It is to take a
      page of some approved writer and read it over repeatedly until the matter,
      not the words, be fully impressed on the mind. Then write, in your own
      language, the same matter. A comparison of the one with the other will
      enable you to remark and correct your own defects. This course may be
      pursued after having made some progress in composition. In the
      commencement, the student ought carefully to reperuse what he has written,
      correct, in the first instance, every error of orthography and grammar. A
      mistake in either is unpardonable. Afterwards revise and improve the
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am pleased with both your pieces of composition. The subjects are well
      chosen and of the deepest interest. Happiness is pursued by all, though
      too many mistake the road by which the greatest good is to be successfully
      followed. Its abode is not always in the palace or the cottage. Its
      residence is the human heart, and its inseparable companion is a quiet
      conscience. Of this, Religion is the surest and safest foundation. The
      individual who turns his thoughts frequently to an omnipotent omniscient
      and all perfect being, who feels his dependence on, and his infinite
      obligations to that being will avoid that course of life which must harrow
      up the conscience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marshall was usually most scrupulous to steer clear of partisan politics
      both in his letters and in 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
			his conversation, so that on one occasion he was much aroused by a 
			newspaper article which had represented him &ldquo;as using language 
			which could be uttered only by an angry party man.&rdquo; But on
      political issues of a broader nature he expressed himself freely in the
      strict privacy of correspondence at least, and sometimes identified
      himself with public movements, especially in his home State. For instance,
      he favored the gradual abolition of slavery by private emancipation rather
      than by governmental action. In 1823 he became first president of the
      Richmond branch of the Colonization Society; five years later he presided
      over a convention to promote internal improvements in Virginia; and in
      1829 he took a prominent part in the deliberations of the State
      Constitutional Convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the broader matters of national concern his political creed was in
      thorough agreement with his constitutional doctrine. Nullification he
      denounced as &ldquo;wicked folly,&rdquo; and he warmly applauded 
			Jackson&rsquo;s proclamation of warning to South Carolina. But 
			Marshall regarded with dismay Jackson&rsquo;s aggrandizement of 
			the executive branch, and the one adverse criticism he has left of 
			the Constitution is of the method provided for the election of the 
			President. In this connection 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
			he wrote in 1830: &ldquo;My own private mind has been slowly and 
			reluctantly advancing to the belief that the present mode of 
			choosing the Chief Magistrate threatens the most serious danger 
			to the public happiness. The passions of men are influenced to so 
			fearful an extent, large masses are so embittered against each other, 
			that I dread the consequences.&hellip; Age is, perhaps, unreasonably 
			timid. Certain it is that I now dread consequences that I once thought 
			imaginary. I feel disposed to take refuge under some less turbulent 
			and less dangerous mode of choosing the Chief Magistrate.&rdquo; Then
      follows the suggestion that the people of the United States elect a body
      of persons equal in number to one-third of the Senate and that the
      President be chosen from among this body by lot. Marshall&rsquo;s 
			suggestion seems absurd enough today, but it should be remembered that 
			his fears of national disorder as a result of strong party feeling at 
			the time of presidential elections were thoroughly realized in 1860 
			when Lincoln&rsquo;s election led to secession and civil war, and that 
			sixteen years later, in the Hayes-Tilden contest, a second dangerous 
			crisis was narrowly averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the campaign of 1832 Marshall espoused privately the cause of Clay and
      the United States 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
			Bank, and could not see why Virginia should not be of the same opinion. 
			Writing to Story in the midst of the campaign he said: &ldquo;We are 
			up to the chin in politics. Virginia was always insane enough to
      be opposed to the Bank of the United States, and therefore hurrahs for the
      veto. But we are a little doubtful how it may work in Pennsylvania. It is
      not difficult to account for the part New York may take. She has sagacity
      enough to see her interests in putting down the present Bank. Her
      mercantile position gives her a control, a commanding control, over the
      currency and the exchanges of the country, if there be no Bank of the
      United States. Going for herself she may approve this policy; but Virginia
      ought not to drudge for her.&rdquo; To the end of his days Marshall seems 
			to have refused to recognize that the South had a sectional interest to
      protect, or at least that Virginia&rsquo;s interests were sectional; her
      attachment to State Rights he assigned to the baneful influence of
      Jeffersonianism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1831 dealt Marshall two severe blows. In that year his robust
      constitution manifested the first signs of impairment, and he was forced
      to undergo an operation for stone. In the days before an&aelig;sthetics, 
			such an operation, especially in the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
			case of a person of his advanced years,
      was attended with great peril. He faced the ordeal with the utmost
      composure. His physician tells of visiting Marshall the morning he was to
      submit to the knife and of finding him at breakfast:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      He received me with a pleasant smile &hellip; and said, &ldquo;Well, 
			Doctor, you find me taking breakfast, and I assure you I have had a 
			good one. I thought it very probable that this might be my last chance, 
			and therefore I was determined to enjoy it and eat heartily.&rdquo; 
			&hellip; He said that he had not the slightest desire to live, 
			laboring under the sufferings to which he was subjected, and that 
			he was perfectly ready to take all the chances of an operation, and 
			he knew there were many against him.&hellip; After he had finished 
			his breakfast, I administered him some medicine; he then inquired at 
			what hour the operation would be performed. I mentioned the hour of
      eleven. He said &ldquo;Very well; do you wish me for any other purpose, 
			or may I lie down and go to sleep?&rdquo; I was a good deal surprised 
			at this question, but told him that if he could sleep it would be very 
			desirable. He immediately placed himself upon the bed and fell into a 
			profound sleep, and continued so until I was obliged to rouse him in 
			order to undergo the operation. He exhibited the same fortitude, 
			scarcely uttering a murmur throughout the whole procedure which, 
			from the nature of his complaint, was necessarily tedious.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      The death of his wife on Christmas Day of the same year was a heavy blow.
      Despite her 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
			invalidism, she was a woman of much force of character and
      many graces of mind, to which Marshall rendered touching tribute in a
      quaint eulogy composed for one of his sons on the first anniversary of her
      death:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Her judgment was so sound and so safe that I have often relied upon it in
      situations of some perplexity.&hellip; Though serious as well as gentle in 
			her deportment, she possessed a good deal of chaste, delicate, and playful
      wit, and if she permitted herself to indulge this talent, told her little
      story with grace, and could mimic very successfully the peculiarities of
      the person who was its subject. She had a fine taste for belle-lettre
      reading.&hellip; This quality, by improving her talents for conversation,
      contributed not inconsiderably to make her a most desirable and agreeable
      companion. It beguiled many of those winter evenings during which her
      protracted ill health and her feeble nervous system confined us entirely
      to each other. I shall never cease to look back on them with deep interest
      and regret.&hellip; She felt deeply the distress of others, and indulged 
			the feeling liberally on objects she believed to be meritorious.&hellip; 
			She was a firm believer in the faith inculcated by the Church in which 
			she was bred, but her soft and gentle temper was incapable of adopting the 
			gloomy and austere dogmas which some of its professors have sought to 
			engraft on it.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      Marshall believed women were the intellectual equals of men, because he
      was convinced that they 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
			possessed in a high degree &ldquo;those qualities 
			which make up the sum of human happiness and transform the domestic 
			fireside into an elysium,&rdquo; and not because he thought they could 
			compete on even terms in the usual activities of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite these &ldquo;buffetings of fate,&rdquo; the Chief Justice was 
			back in Washington in attendance upon Court in February, 1832, and daily 
			walked several miles to and from the Capitol. In the following January 
			his health appeared to be completely restored. &ldquo;He seemed,&rdquo; 
			says Story, with whom he messed, along with Justices Thompson and Duval, 
			&ldquo;to revive, and enjoy anew his green old age.&rdquo; This year 
			Marshall had the gratification of receiving the tribute of Story&rsquo;s 
			magnificent dedication of his <i>Commentaries</i> to him. With 
			characteristic modesty, the aged Chief Justice expressed the fear that 
			his admirer had &ldquo;consulted a partial friendship farther than your 
			deliberate judgment will approve.&rdquo; He was especially interested in
      the copy intended for the schools, but he felt that &ldquo;south of the 
			Potomac, where it is most wanted it will be least used,&rdquo; for, he 
			continued, &ldquo;it is a Mohammedan rule never to dispute with the 
			ignorant, and we of the true faith in the South adjure the contamination 
			of infidel political works. It 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
			would give our orthodox nullifyer a fever 
			to read the heresies of your Commentaries. A whole school might be 
			infected by the atmosphere of a single copy should it be placed on one 
			of the shelves of a bookcase.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall sat on the Bench for the last time in the January term of 1835.
      Miss Harriet Martineau, who was in Washington during that winter, has left
      a striking picture of the Chief Justice as he appeared in these last days.
      &ldquo;How delighted,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;we were to see Judge Story 
			bring in the tall, majestic, bright-eyed old man,&mdash;old by chronology, 
			by the lines on his composed face, and by his services to the republic; 
			but so dignified, so fresh, so present to the time, that no compassionate
      consideration for age dared mix with the contemplation of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall was, however, a very sick man, suffering constant pain from a
      badly diseased liver. The ailment was greatly aggravated, moreover, by
      &ldquo;severe contusions&rdquo; which he received while returning in the 
			stage from Washington to Richmond. In June he went a second time to 
			Philadelphia for medical assistance, but his case was soon seen to be 
			<ins title="Add period after hopeless.">hopeless.</ins> He awaited
      death with his usual serenity, and two days before it came he composed the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
      modest epitaph which appeared upon his tomb: <span class="smcap">John 
			Marshall, son of Thomas and Mary Marshall, was born on the 24th of  
			September, 1755, Intermarried with Mary Willis Ambler the 3d of January, 
			1783, departed this life the &mdash; day of &mdash;, 18&mdash;</span>. 
			He died the evening of July 6, 1835, surrounded by three of his sons. The 
			death of the fourth, from an accident while he was hurrying to his 
			father&rsquo;s bedside, had been kept from him. He left also a daughter 
			and numerous grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s will is dated April 9, 1832, and has five codicils of
      subsequent dates attached. After certain donations to grandsons named John
      and Thomas, the estate, consisting chiefly of his portion of the Fairfax
      purchase, was to be divided equally among his five children. To the
      daughter and her descendants were also secured one hundred shares of stock
      which his wife had held in the Bank of the United States, but in 1835
      these were probably of little value. His faithful body servant Robin was
      to be emancipated and, if he chose, sent to Liberia, in which event he
      should receive one hundred dollars. But if he preferred to remain in the
      Commonwealth, he should receive but fifty dollars; and if it turned out to
      &ldquo;be impracticable to liberate 
   		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
			him consistently with law and his own inclination,&rdquo; he was to 
			select his master from among the children, &ldquo;that he may always 
			be treated as a faithful meritorious servant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief Justice&rsquo;s death evoked many eloquent tributes to his public
      services and private excellencies, but none more just and appreciative
      than that of the officers of court and members of the bar of his own
      circuit who knew him most intimately. It reads as follows:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      John Marshall, late Chief Justice of the United States, having departed
      this life since the last Term of the Federal Circuit Court for this
      district, the Bench, Bar, and Officers of the Court, assembled at the
      present Term, embrace the first opportunity to express their profound and
      heartfelt respect for the memory of the venerable judge, who presided in
      this Court for thirty-five years&mdash;with such remarkable diligence in
      office, that, until he was disabled by the disease which removed him from
      life, he was never known to be absent from the bench, during term time,
      even for a day,&mdash;with such indulgence to counsel and suitors, that
      every body&rsquo;s convenience was consulted, but his own,&mdash;with a 
			dignity, sustained without effort, and, apparently, without care to 
			sustain it, to which all men were solicitous to pay due 
			respect,&mdash;with such profound sagacity, such quick penetration, such 
			acuteness, clearness, strength, and comprehension of mind, that in his 
			hand, the most complicated causes were plain, the weightiest 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
			and most difficult, easy and light,&mdash;with such striking impartiality 
			and justice, and a judgment so sure, as to inspire universal confidence, 
			so that few appeals were ever taken from his decisions, during his long 
			administration of justice in the Court, and those only in cases where he 
			himself expressed doubt,&mdash;with such modesty, that he seemed wholly 
			unconscious of his own gigantic powers,&mdash;with such equanimity, such 
			benignity of temper, such amenity of manners, that not only none of the 
			judges, who sat with him on the bench, but no member of the bar, no 
			officer of the court, no juror, no witness, no suitor, in a single 
			instance, ever found or imagined, in any thing said or done, or omitted 
			by him, the slightest cause of offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His private life was worthy of the exalted character he sustained in
      public station. The unaffected simplicity of his manners; the spotless
      purity of his morals; his social, gentle, cheerful disposition; his
      habitual self-denial, and boundless generosity towards others; the
      strength and constancy of his attachments; his kindness to his friends and
      neighbours; his exemplary conduct in the relations of son, brother,
      husband, father; his numerous charities; his benevolence towards all men,
      and his ever active beneficence; these amiable qualities shone so
      conspicuously in him, throughout his life, that, highly as he was
      respected, he had the rare happiness to be yet more beloved.

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">In</span> the brief period of twenty-seven months 
			following the death of Marshall the Supreme Court received a new Chief 
			Justice and five new Associate Justices. The effect of this change in 
			personnel upon the doctrine of the Court soon became manifest. In the 
			eleventh volume of Peters&rsquo;s <i>Reports,</i> the first issued while 
			Roger B. Taney was Chief Justice, are three decisions of constitutional 
			cases sustaining state laws which on earlier argument Marshall had 
			assessed as unconstitutional. The first of these decisions gave what 
			was designated &ldquo;the complete, unqualified, and exclusive&rdquo; 
			power of the State to regulate its &ldquo;internal police&rdquo; the right
      of way over the &ldquo;commerce clause&rdquo; &sup1;; the second 
			practically nullified the constitutional prohibition against 
			&ldquo;bills of credit&rdquo; in deference to the same high prerogative 
			&sup2;; the third curtailed 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
			the operation of the &ldquo;obligation of contracts&rdquo; clause as a 
			protection of public grants. &sup3; Story, voicing &ldquo;an earnest 
			desire to vindicate his [Marshall&rsquo;s] memory from the imputation 
			of rashness,&rdquo; filed passionate and unavailing dissents. With 
			difficulty he was dissuaded from resigning from a tribunal whose days 
			of influence he thought gone by. <span class="superscript">4</span> 
			During the same year Justice Henry Baldwin, another of Marshall&rsquo;s 
			friends and associates, published his <i>View of the Constitution,</i> 
			in which he rendered high praise to the departed Chief Justice&rsquo;s 
			qualifications as expounder of the Constitution. &ldquo;No

      But the radical impulse soon spent itself. Chief Justice Taney himself was
      a good deal of a conservative. While he regarded the Supreme Court rather
      as an umpire between two sovereignties than as an organ of the National
      Government for the vigorous assertion of its powers, which was 
			Marshall&rsquo;s point of view, Taney was not at all disposed to disturb 
			the law as it had been declared by his predecessor in binding decisions. 
			Then, too, the development of railroading and the beginning of immigration 
			from Europe on a large scale reawakened the interest of a great part of 
			the nation in keeping intercourse between the States untrammeled by local 
			selfishness; and in 1851 the Court, heeding the spirit of compromise of 
			the day, decisively accepted for the most important category of cases 
			Marshall&rsquo;s
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
      principle of the exclusive control of interstate and foreign commerce by

    <p>
      Still, until the eve of the Civil War, the theory of the Constitution held
      by the great body of the people, North as well as South, was that it was a
      compact of States. Then in December, 1860, South Carolina announced her
      secession from the Union. Buchanan&rsquo;s message of the same month 
			performed the twofold service of refuting secession on State Rights 
			principles and of demonstrating, albeit unwittingly, how impossible it was 
			practically to combat the movement on the same principles. Lincoln brought 
			the North back to Marshall&rsquo;s position when he remarked in his 
			Inaugural Address: &ldquo;Continue to execute all the express provisions 
			of our National Constitution, and the Union will endure forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Civil War has been characterized as &ldquo;an appeal from the 
			judgments of Marshall to the arbitrament of war.&rdquo; Its outcome 
			restored the concept of the National Government as a territorial 
			sovereign, present within the States by the superior mandate of the 
			American People, and entitled to &ldquo;execute on every foot of 
			American soil the powers and functions that belong to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
			it.&rdquo; &sup1; These powers and functions are, moreover, today
      undergoing constant enlargement. No one now doubts that in any clash
      between national and state power it is national power which is entitled to
      be defined first, and few persons question that it ought to be defined in
      the light of Marshall&rsquo;s principle, that a Constitution designed for 
			ages to come must be &ldquo;adapted to the various crises of human 
			affairs.&rdquo;

      It is only when we turn to that branch of Constitutional Law which defines
      governmental power in relation to private rights that we lose touch with
      Marshall&rsquo;s principles. As we have seen, he dealt in absolutes: either
      power was given to an unlimited extent or it was withheld altogether.
      Today, however, the dominant rule in this field of Constitutional Law is
      the &ldquo;rule of reason.&rdquo; In the last analysis, there are few 
			private rights which are not subordinate to the general welfare; but, on 
			the other hand, legislation which affects private rights must have a 
			reasonable tendency to promote the general welfare and must not 
			arbitrarily invade the rights of particular persons or classes. Inasmuch 
			as the hard and fast rules of an age when conditions of life were simpler 
			are no longer practicable under 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
			the more complex relationships of modern times, there is today an
      inevitable tendency to force these rules to greater flexibility. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_229-1" name="footer_229-1"></a>
				&sup1; Notwithstanding what is said above, it is also true that the
				modern doctrine of &ldquo;the police power&rdquo; owes something to 
				Marshall&rsquo;s interpretation of the &ldquo;necessary and 
				proper&rdquo; clause in M&rsquo;Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, which 
				is frequently offered nowadays as stating the authoritative definition 
				of &ldquo;a fair legislative discretion&rdquo; in relation to private 
				rights. Indeed this ingenious transposition was first suggested in 
				Marshall&rsquo;s day. See Cowen (N. Y.), 585. But it never
				received his sanction and does not represent his point of view.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      And this difference in the point of view of the judiciary connotes a
      general difference of outlook which makes itself felt today even in that
      field where Marshall wrought most enduringly. The Constitution was
      established under the sway of the idea of the balance of power, and with
      the purpose of effecting a compromise among a variety of more or less
      antagonistic interests, some of which were identified with the cause of
      local autonomy, others of which coalesced with the cause of National
      Supremacy. The Nation and the States were regarded as competitive forces,
      and a condition of tension between them was thought to be not only normal
      but desirable. The modern point of view is very different. Local
      differences have to a great extent disappeared, and that general interest
      which 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
			is the same for all the States is an ever deepening one. The idea of
      the competition of the States with the Nation is yielding to that of their
      co&ouml;peration in public service. And it is much the same with the 
			relation of the three departments of Government. The notion that they have
      antagonistic interests to guard is giving way to the perception of a
      general interest guarded by all according to their several faculties. In
      brief, whereas it was the original effort of the Constitution to preserve
      a somewhat complex set of values by nice differentiations of power, the
      present tendency, born of a surer vision of a single national welfare, is
      toward the participation of all powers in a joint effort for a common end.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Marshall&rsquo;s work has been superseded at many points, there 
			is no fame among American statesmen more strongly bulwarked by great and 
			still vital institutions. Marshall established judicial review; he 
			imparted to an ancient legal tradition a new significance; he made his 
			Court one of the great political forces of the country; he founded 
			American Constitutional Law; he formulated, more tellingly than any one 
			else and for a people whose thought was permeated with legalism, the 
			principles on which the integrity and ordered growth 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
			of their Nation have depended.
      Springing from the twin rootage of Magna Charta and the Declaration of
      Independence, his judicial statesmanship finds no parallel in the salient
      features of its achievement outside our own annals.

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">All</span> accounts of Marshall&rsquo;s career 
			previous to his appointment as Chief Justice have been superseded by 
			Albert J. Beveridge&rsquo;s two admirable volumes, <i>The Life of John 
			Marshall</i> (Boston, 1916). The author paints on a large canvas and with 
			notable skill. His work is history as well as biography. His ample plan 
			enables him to quote liberally from Marshall&rsquo;s writings and from 
			all the really valuable first-hand sources. Both text and notes are 
			valuable repositories of material. Beveridge has substantially completed 
			a third volume covering the first decade of Marshall&rsquo;s 
			chief-justiceship, and the entire work will probably run to
      five volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefer accounts of Marshall covering his entire career will be found in
      Henry Flanders&rsquo;s <i>Lives and Times of the Chief Justices of the 
			Supreme Court</i> (1875) and Van Santvoord&rsquo;s <i>Sketches of the 
			Lives, Times, and Judicial Services of the Chief Justices of the Supreme 
			Court</i> (1882). Two excellent brief sketches are J.&nbsp;B. 
			Thayer&rsquo;s <i>John Marshall</i> (1901) in the <i>Riverside 
			Biographical Series,</i> and W.&nbsp;D. Lewis&rsquo;s essay in the second
      volume of <i>The Great American Lawyers,</i> 8 vols. (Philadelphia, 1907), 
			of which he is also the editor. The latter is particularly happy in its 
			blend of the personal and legal, the biographical and critical. 
			A.&nbsp;B. Magruder&rsquo;s <i>John Marshall</i> (1898) in the 
			<i>American Statesman Series</i> falls
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
      considerably below the general standard maintained by that excellent
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
      The centennial anniversary of Marshall&rsquo;s accession to the Supreme 
			Bench was generally observed by Bench and Bar throughout the United 
			States, and many of the addresses on the great Chief Justice&rsquo;s life 
			and judicial services delivered by distinguished judges and lawyers on 
			that occasion were later collected by John F. Dillon and published in 
			<i>John Marshall, Life, Character, and Judicial Services,</i> 3 vols. 
			(Chicago, 1903). In volume XIII of the <i>Green Bag</i> will be found a 
			skillfully constructed mosaic biography of Marshall drawn from these 
			addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most considerable group of Marshall&rsquo;s letters yet published are 
			those to Justice Story, which will be found in the <i>Massachusetts 
			Historical Society Proceedings,</i> Second Series, volume XIV, pp. 321-60. 
			These and most of the Chief Justice&rsquo;s other letters which have thus 
			far seen the light of day will be found in J.&nbsp;E. Oster&rsquo;s 
			<i>Political and Economic Doctrines of John Marshall</i> (New York, 1914). 
			Here also will be found a copy of Marshall&rsquo;s will, of the 
			autobiography which he prepared in 1818 for Delaplaine&rsquo;s 
			<i>Repository</i> but which was never published there, and of his eulogy 
			of his wife. The two principal sources of Marshall&rsquo;s anecdotes are 
			the <i>Southern Literary Messenger,</i> volume II, p. 181 ff., and Henry
      Howe&rsquo;s <i>Historical Collections of Virginia</i> (Charleston, 1845).
      Approaching the value of sources are Joseph Story&rsquo;s <i>Discourse 
			upon the Life, Character, and Services of the Hon. John Marshall</i> 
			(1835) and Horace Binney&rsquo;s <i>Eulogy</i> (1835), both of which were 
			pronounced by personal friends shortly after Marshall&rsquo;s death and 
			both of which are now available in volume III of Dillon&rsquo;s 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
			compilation, cited above. The value of Marshall&rsquo;s <i>Life of 
			Washington</i> as bearing on the origin of his own point of view in 
			politics was noted in the text (Chapter VIII).
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s great constitutional decisions are, of course, accessible 
			in the <i>Reports,</i> but they have also been assembled into a single 
			volume by John M. Dillon, <i>John Marshall; Complete Constitutional 
			Decisions</i> (Chicago, 1903), and into two instructively edited volumes 
			by Joseph P. Cotton, <i>Constitutional Decisions of John Marshall</i> 
			(New York, 1905). Story&rsquo;s famous <i>Commentaries on the 
			Constitution</i> gives a systematic presentation of Marshall&rsquo;s 
			constitutional doctrines, which is fortified at all points by historical 
			reference; the second edition is the best. For other contemporary 
			evaluations of Marshall&rsquo;s decisions, often hostile, see early 
			volumes of the <i>North American Review</i> and Niles&rsquo;s 
			<i>Register;</i> also the volumes of the famous John Taylor of Caroline. 
			A brief general account of later date of the decisions is to be found in 
			the <i>Constitutional History of the United States as Seen in the 
			Development of American Law</i> (New York, 1889), a course of lectures 
			before the Political Science Association of the University of Michigan. 
			Detailed commentary of a high order of scholarship is furnished by Walter 
			Malins Rose&rsquo;s <i>Notes</i> to the Lawyers&rsquo; Edition of the 
			<i>United States Reports,</i> 13 vols. (1899-1901). The more valuable of 
			Marshall&rsquo;s decisions on circuit are collected in J.&nbsp;W. 
			Brockenbrough&rsquo;s two volumes of <i>Reports of Cases Decided by the 
			Hon. John Marshall</i> (Philadelphia, 1837), and his rulings at 
			Burr&rsquo;s Trial are to be found in  Robertson&rsquo;s <i>Reports of 
			the Trials of Colonel Aaron Burr,</i> 2 vols. (1808).
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshall&rsquo;s associates on the Supreme Bench are pleasingly sketched 
			in Hampton L. Carson&rsquo;s <i>Supreme 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
			Court of the United States</i> (Philadelphia, 1891), which also gives 
			many interesting facts bearing on the history of the Court itself. In 
			the same connection Charles Warren&rsquo;s <i>History of the American 
			Bar</i> (Boston, 1911) is also valuable both for the facts which it
      records and for the guidance it affords to further material. Of 
			biographies of contemporaries and coworkers of Marshall, the most valuable
      are John P. Kennedy&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs of the Life of William Wirt,</i> 2 
			vols. (Philadelphia, 1860); William Wetmore Story&rsquo;s <i>Life and 
			Letters of Joseph Story,</i> 2 vols. (Boston, 1851); and William 
			Kent&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs and Letters of James Kent</i> (Boston, 1898). 
			Everett P. Wheeler&rsquo;s <i>Daniel Webster the Expounder of the 
			Constitution</i> (1905) is instructive, but claims far too much for 
			Webster&rsquo;s influence upon Marshall&rsquo;s views. New England has 
			never yet quite forgiven Virginia for having had the temerity to take the
      formative hand in shaping our Constitutional Law. The vast amount of
      material brought together in Gustavus Myers&rsquo;s <i>History of the 
			Supreme Court</i> (Chicago, 1912) is based on purely <i>ex parte</i> 
			statements and is so poorly authenticated as to be valueless. He writes 
			from the socialistic point of view and fluctuates between the desire to 
			establish the dogma of &ldquo;class bias&rdquo; by a coldly impartial 
			examination of the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; and the desire to start a scandal 
			reflecting on individual reputations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The literature of eulogy and appreciation is, for all practical purposes,
      exhausted in Dillon&rsquo;s collection. But a reference should be made 
			here to a brief but pertinent and excellently phrased comment on the great 
			Chief Justice in Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s <i>Constitutional Government in 
			the United States</i> (New York, 1908), pp. 158-9.

      <h2>Transcriber's Notes</h2>
	    <p><br></p>
	    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    </div>		
    <p>
		The Chronicles of America Series has two similar editions of each volume in	 
		the series.  One version is the Abraham Lincoln edition of the series, a 
		premium version which includes full-page pictures.  A textbook edition was 
		also produced, which does not contain the pictures and captions associated 
		with the pictures, but is otherwise the same book.  This book was produced 
		to match the textbook edition of the book.
		</p>
		<p>
		We have retained the original punctuation and spelling in the book, but
		there are a few exceptions.  Obvious errors were corrected--and all of 
		these changes can be found in the <i>Detailed Notes Section</i> of these
		notes.  The <i>Detailed Notes Section</i> also includes 
		issues that have come up during transcription.  One common issue is that 
		words are sometimes split into two lines for spacing purposes in the 
		original text.  These words are hyphenated in the physical book, but there 
		is a question sometimes as to whether the hyphen should be retained in 
		transcription.  The reasons behind some of these decisions are itemized.
		</p>
		<p>
		We place footnotes after the paragraph in which they are referenced.
		The footnote may appear on a different page number in this e-book as 
		compared to the paper book. For example, the footnote with <i>Nereide</i> 
		appears on page 118 in the paper book, but on page 119 in this e-book.  
		For some index entries with notes, the reference may appear on the page 
		following the one mentioned in the index. 
		<p><br></p>

<h3>Detailed Notes Section:</h3>


    <p>
        On <a href="#Page_27">Page 27</a>, health-giving was hyphenated between
				two lines for spacing and could be transcribed as healthgiving.  We 
				retained the hyphen in transcribing the word. 
    </p>
   <p>
        On <a href="#Page_55">Page 55</a>, elbow-room was hyphenated between
				two lines for spacing and could be transcribed as elbowroom.  We 
				retained the hyphen in transcribing the word. 
    </p>
		<p>
		    On <a href="#Page_87">Page 87</a>, rendez-vous was hyphenated between
				two lines for spacing and could be transcribed as rendezvous.  In this
				case, the latter option took preference:  "He also made the island both 
				a convenient rendezvous for his adherents ..."
		<p>
        On <a href="#Page_208">Page 208</a>, add missing period after uncle to 
				conclude the clause "the literary executor of his famous uncle."
    </p>
		<p>
        On <a href="#Page_220">Page 220</a>, add missing period after hopeless
				to conclude the clause "but his case was soon seen to be hopeless."

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade; works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg&trade; License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg&trade; work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

Gutenberg&trade; License.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&trade; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works provided
that</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
   * You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
   * You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg &trade; works.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
   * You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
   * You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; works.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.F.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg&trade;
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES: Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  <i>You agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in Paragraph F3.  You agree that the Foundation, the 
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be 
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or 
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage. </i>
</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND: If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', <em>with no other 
warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to 
warranties of merchantibility or fitness for any purpose.</em>
</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
1.F.6.  INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg&trade;
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<p class="noindent bold double-space-top">
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
Project Gutenberg &trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg's&trade;
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.</p>

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<em>send donations</em> or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate.</p>

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg&trade;
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
